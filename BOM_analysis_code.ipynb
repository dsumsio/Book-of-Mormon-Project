       "\"THE BOOK OF MORMON\\n\\nAn Account Written by\\nTHE HAND OF MORMON\\nUPON PLATES\\nTAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI\\n\\nWherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of\\nNephi, and also of the Lamanites--Written to the Lamanites, who\\nare a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and\\nGentile--Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of\\nprophecy and of revelation--Written and sealed up, and hid up\\nunto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed--To come forth by\\nthe gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof--Sealed\\nby the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in\\ndue time by way of the Gentile--The interpretation thereof by the\\ngift of God.\\n\\nAn abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a\\nrecord of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the\\nLord confounded the language of the people, when they were\\nbuilding a tower to get to heaven--Which is to show unto the\\nremnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath\\ndone for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of\\nthe Lord, that they are not cast off forever--And also to the\\nconvincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the\\nETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations--And now, if\\nthere are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn\\nnot the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the\\njudgment-seat of Christ.\\n\\nTRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, JUN.\\n\\n\\nTHE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES\\n\\nBe it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto\\nwhom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the\\nFather, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which\\ncontain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi,\\nand also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people\\nof Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken.  And\\nwe also know that they have been translated by the gift and power\\nof God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know\\nof a surety that the work is true.  And we also testify that we\\nhave seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have\\nbeen shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man.  And we\\ndeclare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down\\nfrom heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we\\nbeheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we\\nknow that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord\\nJesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things\\nare true.  And it is marvelous in our eyes.  Nevertheless, the\\nvoice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it;\\nwherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear\\ntestimony of these things.  And we know that if we are faithful\\nin Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and\\nbe found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall\\ndwell with him eternally in the heavens.  And the honor be to the\\nFather, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. \\nAmen.\\n\\nOLIVER COWDERY\\nDAVID WHITMER\\nMARTIN HARRIS\\n\\n\\nTHE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES\\n\\nBe it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto\\nwhom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the\\ntranslator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which\\nhath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many\\nof the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with\\nour hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which\\nhas the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. \\nAnd this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said\\nSmith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of\\na surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have\\nspoken.

SMITH\\n\\n1 Nephi\\nTHE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI\\nHIS REIGN AND MINISTRY\\nAn account of Lehi and his wife Sariah and his four sons, being\\ncalled, (beginning at the eldest) Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi.\\nThe Lord warns Lehi to depart out of the land of Jerusalem,\\nbecause he prophesieth unto the people concerning their iniquity\\nand they seek to destroy his life. He taketh three days' journey\\ninto the wilderness with his family. Nephi taketh his brethren\\nand returneth to the land of Jerusalem after the record of the\\nJews. The account of their sufferings. They take the daughters of\\nIshmael to wife. They take their families and depart into the\\nwilderness. Their sufferings and afflictions in the wilderness.\\nThe course of their travels. They come to the large waters.\\nNephi's brethren rebel against him. He confoundeth them, and\\nbuildeth a ship. They call the name of the place Bountiful. They\\ncross the large waters into the promised land, and so forth. This\\nis according to the account of Nephi; or in other words, I,\\nNephi, wrote this record.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:1\\n 1 I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was\\ntaught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen\\nmany afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having\\nbeen highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a\\ngreat knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God,\\ntherefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:2\\n 2 Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which\\nconsists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the\\nEgyptians.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:3\\n 3 And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it\\nwith mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:4\\n 4 For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of\\nthe reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having\\ndwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there\\ncame many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must\\nrepent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:5\\n 5 Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went\\nforth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in\\nbehalf of his people.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:6\\n 6 And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a\\npillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and\\nheard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he\\ndid quake and tremble exceedingly.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at\\nJerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with\\nthe Spirit and the things which he had seen.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:8\\n 8 And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away\\nin a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he\\nsaw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless\\nconcourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising\\ntheir God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the\\nmidst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of\\nthe sun at noon-day.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:10\\n 10 And he also saw twelve others following him, and their\\nbrightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:11\\n 11 And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth;\\nand the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him\\na book, and bade him that he should read.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the\\nSpirit of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:13\\n 13 And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen\\nthine abominations!  Yea, and many things did my father read\\nconcerning Jerusalem--that it should be destroyed, and the\\ninhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many\\nshould be carried away captive into Babylon.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen\\nmany great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto\\nthe Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God\\nAlmighty!  Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and\\ngoodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth,\\nand, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who\\ncome unto thee that they shall perish!\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:15\\n 15 And after this manner was the language of my father in the\\npraising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole\\nheart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea,\\nwhich the Lord had shown unto him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:16\\n 16 And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things\\nwhich my father hath written, for he hath written many things\\nwhich he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written\\nmany things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of\\nwhich I shall not make a full account.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:17\\n 17 But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. \\nBehold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon\\nplates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I\\nhave abridged the record of my father then will I make an account\\nof mine own life.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:18\\n 18 Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord\\nhad shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea,\\nconcerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth\\namong the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them\\nconcerning the things which he had both seen and heard.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the\\nthings which he testified of them; for he truly testified of\\ntheir wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that\\nthe things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he\\nread in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of the\\nMessiah, and also the redemption of the world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 1:20\\n 20 And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with\\nhim; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast\\nout, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that\\nthey might take it away.  But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto\\nyou that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom\\nhe hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even\\nunto the power of deliverance.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:1\\n 1 For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my\\nfather, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou\\nLehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because\\nthou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things\\nwhich I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in\\na dream, that he should take his family and depart into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the\\nLord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness.  And\\nhe left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold,\\nand his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with\\nhim, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and\\ndeparted into the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:5\\n 5 And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea;\\nand he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer\\nthe Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family,\\nwhich consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who\\nwere Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in\\nthe wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a\\nriver of water.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made\\nan offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that he called the name of the river,\\nLaman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the\\nborders near the mouth thereof.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:9\\n 9 And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied\\ninto the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O\\nthat thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running\\ninto the fountain of all righteousness!\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:10\\n 10 And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like\\nunto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping\\nthe commandments of the Lord!\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:11\\n 11 Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and\\nLemuel; for behold they did murmur in many things against their\\nfather, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of\\nthe land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance,\\nand their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to\\nperish in the wilderness.  And this they said he had done because\\nof the foolish imaginations of his heart.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:12\\n 12 And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur\\nagainst their father.  And they did murmur because they knew not\\nthe dealings of that God who had created them.\\n1 Nephi 2:13\\n 13 Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city,\\ncould be destroyed according to the words of the prophets.  And\\nthey were like unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to\\ntake away the life of my father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the\\nvalley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the Spirit, until\\ntheir frames did shake before him.  And he did confound them,\\nthat they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he\\ncommanded them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:15\\n 15 And my father dwelt in a tent.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young,\\nnevertheless being large in stature, and also having great\\ndesires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry\\nunto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my\\nheart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by\\nmy father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my\\nbrothers.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:17\\n 17 And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which\\nthe Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit.  And it came\\nto pass that he believed in my words.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:18\\n 18 But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my\\nwords; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts\\nI cried unto the Lord for them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying:\\nBlessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast\\nsought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:20\\n 20 And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall\\nprosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land\\nwhich I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above\\nall other lands.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:21\\n 21 And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they\\nshall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:22\\n 22 And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt\\nbe made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:23\\n 23 For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I\\nwill curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no\\npower over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also.\\n\\n1 Nephi 2:24\\n 24 And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a\\nscourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of\\nremembrance.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with\\nthe Lord, to the tent of my father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I\\nhave dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me\\nthat thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:3\\n 3 For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a\\ngenealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of\\nbrass.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:4\\n 4 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy\\nbrothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records,\\nand bring them down hither into the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:5\\n 5 And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing\\nwhich I have required of them; but behold I have not required it\\nof them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:6\\n 6 Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord,\\nbecause thou hast not murmured.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will\\ngo and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know\\nthat the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men,\\nsave he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the\\nthing which he commandeth them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words\\nhe was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of\\nthe Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:9\\n 9 And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the\\nwilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of\\nJerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:11\\n 11 And we cast lots--who of us should go in unto the house of\\nLaban.  And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and\\nLaman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as\\nhe sat in his house.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:12\\n 12 And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon\\nthe plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:13\\n 13 And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust\\nhim out from his presence; and he would not that he should have\\nthe records.  Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a\\nrobber, and I will slay thee.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:14\\n 14 But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which\\nLaban had done, unto us.  And we began to be exceedingly\\nsorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in\\nthe wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:15\\n 15 But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as\\nwe live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness\\nuntil we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath\\ncommanded us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:16\\n 16 Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of\\nthe Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's\\ninheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner\\nof riches.  And all this he hath done because of the commandments\\nof the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:17\\n 17 For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the\\nwickedness of the people.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:18\\n 18 For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets. \\nWherefore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath\\nbeen commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also\\nperish.  Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the\\nland.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:19\\n 19 And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these\\nrecords, that we may preserve unto our children the language of\\nour fathers;\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:20\\n 20 And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have\\nbeen spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have\\nbeen delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since\\nthe world began, even down unto this present time.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I\\npersuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the\\ncommandments of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our\\ninheritance, and we did gather together our gold, and our silver,\\nand our precious things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:23\\n 23 And after we had gathered these things together, we went up\\nagain unto the house of Laban.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired\\nhim that he would give unto us the records which were engraven\\nupon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our\\ngold, and our silver, and all our precious things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and\\nthat it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch\\nthat he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he\\nmight obtain our property.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of\\nLaban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it\\nfell into the hands of Laban.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the\\nservants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in\\nthe cavity of a rock.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also\\nwith my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the\\nwords of Laman.  Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard\\nwords unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even\\nwith a rod.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:29\\n 29 And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an\\nangel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto\\nthem, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? \\nKnow ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you,\\nand this because of your iniquities?  Behold ye shall go up to\\nJerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:30\\n 30 And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 3:31\\n 31 And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again\\nbegan to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will\\ndeliver Laban into our hands?  Behold, he is a mighty man, and he\\ncan command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?\\n\\n1 Nephi 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let\\nus go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping\\nthe commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all\\nthe earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea,\\nor even than his tens of thousands?\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:2\\n 2 Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for\\nhe truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided\\nhither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of\\ncaptivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow\\nand were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:3\\n 3 Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an\\nangel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt?  Let us go\\nup; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to\\ndestroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:4\\n 4 Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and\\ndid still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up\\nuntil we came without the walls of Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:5\\n 5 And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide\\nthemselves without the walls.  And after they had hid themselves,\\nI, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of\\nLaban.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:6\\n 6 And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things\\nwhich I should do.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:7\\n 7 Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house\\nof Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before\\nme, for he was drunken with wine.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:8\\n 8 And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:9\\n 9 And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath\\nthereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the\\nworkmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the\\nblade thereof was of the most precious steel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that\\nI should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time\\nhave I shed the blood of man.  And I shrunk and would that I\\nmight not slay him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:11\\n 11 And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath\\ndelivered him into thy hands.  Yea, and I also knew that he had\\nsought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken\\nunto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our\\nproperty.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay\\nhim, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:13\\n 13 Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his\\nrighteous purposes.  It is better that one man should perish than\\nthat a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:14\\n 14 And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered\\nthe words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness,\\nsaying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments,\\nthey shall prosper in the land of promise.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:15\\n 15 Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the\\ncommandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they\\nshould have the law.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:16\\n 16 And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of\\nbrass.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:17\\n 17 And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my\\nhands for this cause--that I might obtain the records according\\nto his commandments.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:18\\n 18 Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban\\nby the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own\\nsword.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:19\\n 19 And after I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I\\ntook the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea,\\neven every whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:20\\n 20 And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of\\nLaban.  And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban,\\nbehold, I saw the servant of Laban who had the keys of the\\ntreasury.  And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he\\nshould go with me into the treasury.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:21\\n 21 And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the\\ngarments and also the sword girded about my loins.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:22\\n 22 And he spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he\\nknowing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:23\\n 23 And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:24\\n 24 And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings,\\nwhich were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who\\nwere without the walls.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:25\\n 25 And I also bade him that he should follow me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:26\\n 26 And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church,\\nand that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he\\ndid follow me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:27\\n 27 And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the\\nJews, as I went forth unto my brethren, who were without the\\nwalls.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly\\nfrightened, and also Lemuel and Sam.  And they fled from before\\nmy presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had\\nslain me and had sought to take away their lives also.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did\\nhear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my\\nbrethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before\\nme and return to the city of Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:31\\n 31 And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also\\nhaving received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize\\nupon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would\\nhearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so\\nthat if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:33\\n 33 And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not\\nfear; that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go\\ndown in the wilderness with us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:34\\n 34 And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath\\ncommanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in\\nkeeping the commandments of the Lord?  Therefore, if thou wilt go\\ndown into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with\\nus.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words\\nwhich I spake.  Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he\\npromised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our\\nfather.  Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would\\ntarry with us from that time forth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:36\\n 36 Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this\\ncause, that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into\\nthe wilderness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:37\\n 37 And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us,\\nour fears did cease concerning him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 4:38\\n 38 And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the\\nservant of Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journeyed\\nunto the tent of our father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that after we had come down into the\\nwilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and\\nalso my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had\\nmourned because of us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:2\\n 2 For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness;\\nand she also had complained against my father, telling him that\\nhe was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth\\nfrom the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we\\nperish in the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:3\\n 3 And after this manner of language had my mother complained\\nagainst my father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:4\\n 4 And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying:\\nI know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the\\nthings of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of\\nGod, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my\\nbrethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:5\\n 5 But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which\\nthings I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver\\nmy sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto\\nus in the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:6\\n 6 And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort\\nmy mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the\\nwilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of\\nthe Jews.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:7\\n 7 And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold\\ntheir joy was full, and my mother was comforted.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:8\\n 8 And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord\\nhath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I\\nalso know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and\\ndelivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power\\nwhereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath\\ncommanded them.  And after this manner of language did she speak.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did\\noffer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave\\nthanks unto the God of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:10\\n 10 And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my\\nfather, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the\\nplates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:11\\n 11 And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses,\\nwhich gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of\\nAdam and Eve, who were our first parents;\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:12\\n 12 And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down\\nto the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:13\\n 13 And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the\\nbeginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of\\nZedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the\\nmouth of Jeremiah.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the\\nplates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew\\nthat he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was\\nthe son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved\\nby the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father,\\nJacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:15\\n 15 And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land\\nof Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:16\\n 16 And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his\\nfathers.  And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he\\nand his fathers had kept the records.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:17\\n 17 And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled\\nwith the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed--\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:18\\n 18 That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations,\\nkindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:19\\n 19 Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never\\nperish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time.  And he\\nprophesied many things concerning his seed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept\\nthe commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:21\\n 21 And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded\\nus, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea,\\neven of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the\\ncommandments of the Lord unto our children.\\n\\n1 Nephi 5:22\\n 22 Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry\\nthem with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land\\nof promise.\\n\\n1 Nephi 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\n1 Nephi 6:1\\n 1 And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in\\nthis part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after\\nupon these plates which I am writing; for it is given in the\\nrecord which has been kept by my father; wherefore, I do not\\nwrite it in this work.\\n\\n1 Nephi 6:2\\n 2 For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.\\n\\n1 Nephi 6:3\\n 3 And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full\\naccount of all the things of my father, for they cannot be\\nwritten upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write\\nof the things of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 6:4\\n 4 For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to\\ncome unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God\\nof Jacob, and be saved.\\n\\n1 Nephi 6:5\\n 5 Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do\\nnot write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto\\nthose who are not of the world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 6:6\\n 6 Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they\\nshall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth\\nunto the children of men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:1\\n 1 And now I would that ye might know, that after my father,\\nLehi, had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came\\nto pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was\\nnot meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the\\nwilderness alone; but that his sons should take daughters to\\nwife, that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of\\npromise.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi,\\nand my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem,\\nand bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my\\nbrethren, go forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael,\\nand we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we\\ndid speak unto him the words of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of\\nIshmael, and also his household, insomuch that they took their\\njourney with us down into the wilderness to the tent of our\\nfather.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness,\\nbehold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and\\nthe two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us;\\nyea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and\\nhis wife, and his three other daughters.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:7\\n 7 And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous\\nto return unto the land of Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:8\\n 8 And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their\\nhearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying, yea, even unto Laman\\nand unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it\\nthat ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your minds,\\nthat ye have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto\\nyou, yea, and set an example for you?\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:9\\n 9 How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the\\nLord?\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:10\\n 10 How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel\\nof the Lord?\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:11\\n 11 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what great things\\nthe Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of\\nLaban, and also that we should obtain the record?\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:12\\n 12 Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is\\nable to do all things according to his will, for the children of\\nmen, if it so be that they exercise faith in him?  Wherefore, let\\nus be faithful to him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:13\\n 13 And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain\\nthe land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that\\nthe word of the Lord shall be fulfilled concerning the\\ndestruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath\\nspoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:14\\n 14 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive\\nwith them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and\\nJeremiah have they cast into prison.  And they have sought to\\ntake away the life of my father, insomuch that they have driven\\nhim out of the land.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:15\\n 15 Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto\\nJerusalem ye shall also perish with them.  And now, if ye have\\nchoice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak\\nunto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit\\nof the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these\\nwords unto my brethren, they were angry with me.  And it came to\\npass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were\\nexceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they\\nsought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the\\nwilderness to be devoured by wild beasts.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:17\\n 17 But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O\\nLord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver\\nme from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that\\nI may burst these bands with which I am bound.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold,\\nthe bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood\\nbefore my brethren, and I spake unto them again.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that they were angry with me again, and\\nsought to lay hands upon me; but behold, one of the daughters of\\nIshmael, yea, and also her mother, and one of the sons of\\nIshmael, did plead with my brethren, insomuch that they did\\nsoften their hearts; and they did cease striving to take away my\\nlife.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of\\ntheir wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and\\ndid plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that\\nthey had done against me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that\\nthey had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto\\nthe Lord their God for forgiveness.  And it came to pass that\\nthey did so.  And after they had done praying unto the Lord we\\ndid again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 7:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of\\nour father.  And after I and my brethren and all the house of\\nIshmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give\\nthanks unto the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice and\\nburnt offerings unto him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that we had gathered together all manner\\nof seeds of every kind, both of grain of every kind, and also of\\nthe seeds of fruit of every kind.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the\\nwilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have dreamed a\\ndream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:3\\n 3 And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have\\nreason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam;\\nfor I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their\\nseed, will be saved.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:4\\n 4 But behold, Laman and Lemuel, I fear exceedingly because of\\nyou; for behold, methought I saw in my dream, a dark and dreary\\nwilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that I saw a man, and he was dressed in a\\nwhite robe; and he came and stood before me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that he spake unto me, and bade me follow\\nhim.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that as I followed him I beheld myself\\nthat I was in a dark and dreary waste.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:8\\n 8 And after I had traveled for the space of many hours in\\ndarkness, I began to pray unto the Lord that he would have mercy\\non me, according to the multitude of his tender mercies.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:9\\n 9 And it came to pass after I had prayed unto the Lord I beheld\\na large and spacious field.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that I beheld a tree, whose fruit was\\ndesirable to make one happy.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the\\nfruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all\\nthat I ever before tasted.  Yea, and I beheld that the fruit\\nthereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever\\nseen.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:12\\n 12 And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with\\nexceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my\\nfamily should partake of it also; for I knew that it was\\ndesirable above all other fruit.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:13\\n 13 And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might\\ndiscover my family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran\\nalong, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the\\nfruit.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:14\\n 14 And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the\\nhead thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I beheld\\nyour mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they\\nknew not whither they should go.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did\\nsay unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me,\\nand partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other\\nfruit.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that they did come unto me and partake of\\nthe fruit also.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that I was desirous that Laman and Lemuel\\nshould come and partake of the fruit also; wherefore, I cast mine\\neyes towards the head of the river, that perhaps I might see\\nthem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that I saw them, but they would not come\\nunto me and partake of the fruit.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:19\\n 19 And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of\\nthe river, and led to the tree by which I stood.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:20\\n 20 And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along\\nby the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it\\nalso led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious\\nfield, as if it had been a world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:21\\n 21 And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were\\npressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto\\nthe tree by which I stood.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that they did come forth, and commence in\\nthe path which led to the tree.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that there arose a mist of darkness; yea,\\neven an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that they\\nwho had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they\\nwandered off and were lost.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward,\\nand they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of\\niron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness,\\nclinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and\\npartake of the fruit of the tree.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:25\\n 25 And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did\\ncast their eyes about as if they were ashamed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:26\\n 26 And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other\\nside of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it\\nstood as it were in the air, high above the earth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:27\\n 27 And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male\\nand female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and\\nthey were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers\\ntowards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:28\\n 28 And after they had tasted of the fruit they were ashamed,\\nbecause of those that were scoffing at them; and they fell away\\ninto forbidden paths and were lost.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:29\\n 29 And now I, Nephi, do not speak all the words of my father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:30\\n 30 But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes\\npressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the\\nrod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually\\nholding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell\\ndown and partook of the fruit of the tree.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:31\\n 31 And he also saw other multitudes feeling their way towards\\nthat great and spacious building.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that many were drowned in the depths of\\nthe fountain; and many were lost from his view, wandering in\\nstrange roads.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:33\\n 33 And great was the multitude that did enter into that strange\\nbuilding.  And after they did enter into that building they did\\npoint the finger of scorn at me and those that were partaking of\\nthe fruit also; but we heeded them not.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:34\\n 34 These are the words of my father: For as many as heeded them,\\nhad fallen away.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:35\\n 35 And Laman and Lemuel partook not of the fruit, said my\\nfather.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:36\\n 36 And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words\\nof his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because\\nof these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared\\nfor Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off\\nfrom the presence of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:37\\n 37 And he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender\\nparent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the\\nLord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my\\nfather did preach unto them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 8:38\\n 38 And after he had preached unto them, and also prophesied unto\\nthem of many things, he bade them to keep the commandments of the\\nLord; and he did cease speaking unto them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\n1 Nephi 9:1\\n 1 And all these things did my father see, and hear, and speak,\\nas he dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel, and also a great\\nmany more things, which cannot be written upon these plates.\\n\\n1 Nephi 9:2\\n 2 And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they\\nare not the plates upon which I make a full account of the\\nhistory of my people; for the plates upon which I make a full\\naccount of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore,\\nthey are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and\\nthese plates also are called the plates of Nephi.\\n\\n1 Nephi 9:3\\n 3 Nevertheless, I have received a commandment of the Lord that I\\nshould make these plates, for the special purpose that there\\nshould be an account engraven of the ministry of my people.\\n\\n1 Nephi 9:4\\n 4 Upon the other plates should be engraven an account of the\\nreign of the kings, and the wars and contentions of my people;\\nwherefore these plates are for the more part of the ministry; and\\nthe other plates are for the more part of the reign of the kings\\nand the wars and contentions of my people.\\n\\n1 Nephi 9:5\\n 5 Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me to make these plates for\\na wise purpose in him, which purpose I know not.\\n\\n1 Nephi 9:6\\n 6 But the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore,\\nhe prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children\\nof men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all\\nhis words.  And thus it is.  Amen.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:1\\n 1 And now I, Nephi, proceed to give an account upon these plates\\nof my proceedings, and my reign and ministry; wherefore, to\\nproceed with mine account, I must speak somewhat of the things of\\nmy father, and also of my brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:2\\n 2 For behold, it came to pass after my father had made an end of\\nspeaking the words of his dream, and also of exhorting them to\\nall diligence, he spake unto them concerning the Jews--\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:3\\n 3 That after they should be destroyed, even that great city\\nJerusalem, and many be carried away captive into Babylon,\\naccording to the own due time of the Lord, they should return\\nagain, yea, even be brought back out of captivity; and after they\\nshould be brought back out of captivity they should possess again\\nthe land of their inheritance.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:4\\n 4 Yea, even six hundred years from the time that my father left\\nJerusalem, a prophet would the Lord God raise up among the\\nJews--even a Messiah, or, in other words, a Savior of the world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:5\\n 5 And he also spake concerning the prophets, how great a number\\nhad testified of these things, concerning this Messiah, of whom\\nhe had spoken, or this Redeemer of the world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:6\\n 6 Wherefore, all mankind were in a lost and in a fallen state,\\nand ever would be save they should rely on this Redeemer.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:7\\n 7 And he spake also concerning a prophet who should come before\\nthe Messiah, to prepare the way of the Lord--\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:8\\n 8 Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness:\\nPrepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for\\nthere standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier\\nthan I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  And\\nmuch spake my father concerning this thing.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:9\\n 9 And my father said he should baptize in Bethabara, beyond\\nJordan; and he also said he should baptize with water; even that\\nhe should baptize the Messiah with water.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:10\\n 10 And after he had baptized the Messiah with water, he should\\nbehold and bear record that he had baptized the Lamb of God, who\\nshould take away the sins of the world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:11\\n 11 And it came to pass after my father had spoken these words he\\nspake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be\\npreached among the Jews, and also concerning the dwindling of the\\nJews in unbelief.  And after they had slain the Messiah, who\\nshould come, and after he had been slain he should rise from the\\ndead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto\\nthe Gentiles.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:12\\n 12 Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and\\nalso concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared\\nlike unto an olive-tree, whose branches should be broken off and\\nshould be scattered upon all the face of the earth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:13\\n 13 Wherefore, he said it must needs be that we should be led\\nwith one accord into the land of promise, unto the fulfilling of\\nthe word of the Lord, that we should be scattered upon all the\\nface of the earth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:14\\n 14 And after the house of Israel should be scattered they should\\nbe gathered together again; or, in fine, after the Gentiles had\\nreceived the fulness of the Gospel, the natural branches of the\\nolive-tree, or the remnants of the house of Israel, should be\\ngrafted in, or come to the knowledge of the true Messiah, their\\nLord and their Redeemer.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:15\\n 15 And after this manner of language did my father prophesy and\\nspeak unto my brethren, and also many more things which I do not\\nwrite in this book; for I have written as many of them as were\\nexpedient for me in mine other book.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:16\\n 16 And all these things, of which I have spoken, were done as my\\nfather dwelt in a tent, in the valley of Lemuel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:17\\n 17 And it came to pass after I, Nephi, having heard all the\\nwords of my father, concerning the things which he saw in a\\nvision, and also the things which he spake by the power of the\\nHoly Ghost, which power he received by faith on the Son of\\nGod--and the Son of God was the Messiah who should come--I,\\nNephi, was desirous also that I might see, and hear, and know of\\nthese things, by the power of the Holy Ghost, which is the gift\\nof God unto all those who diligently seek him, as well in times\\nof old as in the time that he should manifest himself unto the\\nchildren of men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:18\\n 18 For he is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever; and the\\nway is prepared for all men from the foundation of the world, if\\nit so be that they repent and come unto him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:19\\n 19 For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries\\nof God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy\\nGhost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in\\ntimes of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the\\nLord is one eternal round.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:20\\n 20 Therefore remember, O man, for all thy doings thou shalt be\\nbrought into judgment.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:21\\n 21 Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of\\nyour probation, then ye are found unclean before the\\njudgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God;\\nwherefore, ye must be cast off forever.\\n\\n1 Nephi 10:22\\n 22 And the Holy Ghost giveth authority that I should speak these\\nthings, and deny them not.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11\\nChapter 11\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:1\\n 1 For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things\\nthat my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to\\nmake them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was\\ncaught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly\\nhigh mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I\\nnever had before set my foot.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:2\\n 2 And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:3\\n 3 And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:4\\n 4 And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father\\nsaw the tree of which he hath spoken?\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:5\\n 5 And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of\\nmy father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:6\\n 6 And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a\\nloud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for\\nhe is God over all the earth, yea, even above all.  And blessed\\nart thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most\\nhigh God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast\\ndesired.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:7\\n 7 And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign,\\nthat after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which\\nthy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of\\nheaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him\\nye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look!  And I\\nlooked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my\\nfather had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea,\\nexceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the\\nwhiteness of the driven snow.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:9\\n 9 And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the\\nSpirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is\\nprecious above all.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:10\\n 10 And he said unto me: What desirest thou?\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:11\\n 11 And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof--for\\nI spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in\\nthe form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the\\nSpirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with\\nanother.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look!  And I looked\\nas if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from\\nbefore my presence.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city\\nof Jerusalem, and also other cities.  And I beheld the city of\\nNazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she\\nwas exceedingly fair and white.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel\\ncame down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what\\nbeholdest thou?\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:15\\n 15 And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above\\nall other virgins.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:16\\n 16 And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:17\\n 17 And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children;\\nnevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:18\\n 18 And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is\\nthe mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away\\nin the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit\\nfor the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:20\\n 20 And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in\\nher arms.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:21\\n 21 And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even\\nthe Son of the Eternal Father!  Knowest thou the meaning of the\\ntree which thy father saw?\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:22\\n 22 And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which\\nsheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men;\\nwherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:23\\n 23 And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the\\nsoul.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:24\\n 24 And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! \\nAnd I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the\\nchildren of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship\\nhim.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which\\nmy father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the\\nfountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters\\nare a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that\\nthe tree of life was a representation of the love of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:26\\n 26 And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the\\ncondescension of God!\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:27\\n 27 And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my\\nfather had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should\\nprepare the way before him.  And the Lamb of God went forth and\\nwas baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the\\nheavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and\\nabide upon him in the form of a dove.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:28\\n 28 And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people,\\nin power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered\\ntogether to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from\\namong them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:29\\n 29 And I also beheld twelve others following him.  And it came\\nto pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my\\nface, and I saw them not.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again,\\nsaying: Look!  And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again,\\nand I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they\\ndid minister unto them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:31\\n 31 And he spake unto me again, saying: Look!  And I looked, and\\nI beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. \\nAnd I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were\\nafflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and\\nunclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things\\nunto me.  And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God;\\nand the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again,\\nsaying: Look!  And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he\\nwas taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was\\njudged of the world; and I saw and bear record.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:33\\n 33 And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and\\nslain for the sins of the world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:34\\n 34 And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth,\\nthat they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of\\nthe Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the\\nLord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:35\\n 35 And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I\\nbeheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto\\nthe building which my father saw.  And the angel of the Lord\\nspake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom\\nthereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together\\nto fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.\\n\\n1 Nephi 11:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the\\ngreat and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it\\nfell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great.  And the angel\\nof the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the\\ndestruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that\\nshall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12\\nChapter 12\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Look, and\\nbehold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren.  And I looked\\nand beheld the land of promise; and I beheld multitudes of\\npeople, yea, even as it were in number as many as the sand of the\\nsea.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that I beheld multitudes gathered together\\nto battle, one against the other; and I beheld wars, and rumors\\nof wars, and great slaughters with the sword among my people.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that I beheld many generations pass away,\\nafter the manner of wars and contentions in the land; and I\\nbeheld many cities, yea, even that I did not number them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that I saw a mist of darkness on the face\\nof the land of promise; and I saw lightnings, and I heard\\nthunderings, and earthquakes, and all manner of tumultuous\\nnoises; and I saw the earth and the rocks, that they rent; and I\\nsaw mountains tumbling into pieces; and I saw the plains of the\\nearth, that they were broken up; and I saw many cities that they\\nwere sunk; and I saw many that they were burned with fire; and I\\nsaw many that did tumble to the earth, because of the quaking\\nthereof.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:5\\n 5 And it came to pass after I saw these things, I saw the vapor\\nof darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and\\nbehold, I saw multitudes who had not fallen because of the great\\nand terrible judgments of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:6\\n 6 And I saw the heavens open, and the Lamb of God descending out\\nof heaven; and he came down and showed himself unto them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:7\\n 7 And I also saw and bear record that the Holy Ghost fell upon\\ntwelve others; and they were ordained of God, and chosen.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:8\\n 8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the twelve\\ndisciples of the Lamb, who are chosen to minister unto thy seed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:9\\n 9 And he said unto me: Thou rememberest the twelve apostles of\\nthe Lamb?  Behold they are they who shall judge the twelve tribes\\nof Israel; wherefore, the twelve ministers of thy seed shall be\\njudged of them; for ye are of the house of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:10\\n 10 And these twelve ministers whom thou beholdest shall judge\\nthy seed.  And, behold, they are righteous forever; for because\\nof their faith in the Lamb of God their garments are made white\\nin his blood.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:11\\n 11 And the angel said unto me: Look!  And I looked, and beheld\\nthree generations pass away in righteousness; and their garments\\nwere white even like unto the Lamb of God.  And the angel said\\nunto me: These are made white in the blood of the Lamb, because\\nof their faith in him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:12\\n 12 And I, Nephi, also saw many of the fourth generation who\\npassed away in righteousness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that I saw the multitudes of the earth\\ngathered together.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:14\\n 14 And the angel said unto me: Behold thy seed, and also the\\nseed of thy brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the people of my\\nseed gathered together in multitudes against the seed of my\\nbrethren; and they were gathered together to battle.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:16\\n 16 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the fountain of\\nfilthy water which thy father saw; yea, even the river of which\\nhe spake; and the depths thereof are the depths of hell.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:17\\n 17 And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil,\\nwhich blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children\\nof men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, that they perish\\nand are lost.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:18\\n 18 And the large and spacious building, which thy father saw, is\\nvain imaginations and the pride of the children of men.  And a\\ngreat and a terrible gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of\\nthe justice of the Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the Lamb\\nof God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the beginning\\nof the world until this time, and from this time henceforth and\\nforever.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:19\\n 19 And while the angel spake these words, I beheld and saw that\\nthe seed of my brethren did contend against my seed, according to\\nthe word of the angel; and because of the pride of my seed, and\\nthe temptations of the devil, I beheld that the seed of my\\nbrethren did overpower the people of my seed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that I beheld, and saw the people of the\\nseed of my brethren that they had overcome my seed; and they went\\nforth in multitudes upon the face of the land.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:21\\n 21 And I saw them gathered together in multitudes; and I saw\\nwars and rumors of wars among them; and in wars and rumors of\\nwars I saw many generations pass away.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:22\\n 22 And the angel said unto me: Behold these shall dwindle in\\nunbelief.\\n\\n1 Nephi 12:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that I beheld, after they had dwindled in\\nunbelief they became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people,\\nfull of idleness and all manner of abominations.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13\\nChapter 13\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:\\nLook!  And I looked and beheld many nations and kingdoms.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:2\\n 2 And the angel said unto me: What beholdest thou?  And I said:\\nI behold many nations and kingdoms.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:3\\n 3 And he said unto me: These are the nations and kingdoms of the\\nGentiles.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that I saw among the nations of the\\nGentiles the formation of a great church.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:5\\n 5 And the angel said unto me: Behold the formation of a church\\nwhich is most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth\\nthe saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down,\\nand yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into\\ncaptivity.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that I beheld this great and abominable\\nchurch; and I saw the devil that he was the founder of it.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:7\\n 7 And I also saw gold, and silver, and silks, and scarlets, and\\nfine-twined linen, and all manner of precious clothing; and I saw\\nmany harlots.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:8\\n 8 And the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold the gold, and the\\nsilver, and the silks, and the scarlets, and the fine-twined\\nlinen, and the precious clothing, and the harlots, are the\\ndesires of this great and abominable church.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:9\\n 9 And also for the praise of the world do they destroy the\\nsaints of God, and bring them down into captivity.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld many waters; and\\nthey divided the Gentiles from the seed of my brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that the angel said unto me: Behold the\\nwrath of God is upon the seed of thy brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:12\\n 12 And I looked and beheld a man among the Gentiles, who was\\nseparated from the seed of my brethren by the many waters; and I\\nbeheld the Spirit of God, that it came down and wrought upon the\\nman; and he went forth upon the many waters, even unto the seed\\nof my brethren, who were in the promised land.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that I beheld the Spirit of God, that it\\nwrought upon other Gentiles; and they went forth out of\\ncaptivity, upon the many waters.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the\\nGentiles upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God,\\nthat it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered\\nbefore the Gentiles and were smitten.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:15\\n 15 And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the\\nGentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their\\ninheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceedingly\\nfair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles\\nwho had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before\\nthe Lord; and the power of the Lord was with them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:17\\n 17 And I beheld that their mother Gentiles were gathered\\ntogether upon the waters, and upon the land also, to battle\\nagainst them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:18\\n 18 And I beheld that the power of God was with them, and also\\nthat the wrath of God was upon all those that were gathered\\ntogether against them to battle.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:19\\n 19 And I, Nephi, beheld that the Gentiles that had gone out of\\ncaptivity were delivered by the power of God out of the hands of\\nall other nations.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld that they did\\nprosper in the land; and I beheld a book, and it was carried\\nforth among them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:21\\n 21 And the angel said unto me: Knowest thou the meaning of the\\nbook?\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:22\\n 22 And I said unto him: I know not.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:23\\n 23 And he said: Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew. \\nAnd I, Nephi, beheld it; and he said unto me: The book that thou\\nbeholdest is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants\\nof the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel; and it\\nalso containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and\\nit is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the plates\\nof brass, save there are not so many; nevertheless, they contain\\nthe covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of\\nIsrael; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:24\\n 24 And the angel of the Lord said unto me: Thou hast beheld that\\nthe book proceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew; and when it\\nproceeded forth from the mouth of a Jew it contained the fulness\\nof the gospel of the Lord, of whom the twelve apostles bear\\nrecord; and they bear record according to the truth which is in\\nthe Lamb of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:25\\n 25 Wherefore, these things go forth from the Jews in purity unto\\nthe Gentiles, according to the truth which is in God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:26\\n 26 And after they go forth by the hand of the twelve apostles of\\nthe Lamb, from the Jews unto the Gentiles, thou seest the\\nformation of a great and abominable church, which is most\\nabominable above all other churches; for behold, they have taken\\naway from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and\\nmost precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they\\ntaken away.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:27\\n 27 And all this have they done that they might pervert the right\\nways of the Lord, that they might blind the eyes and harden the\\nhearts of the children of men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:28\\n 28 Wherefore, thou seest that after the book hath gone forth\\nthrough the hands of the great and abominable church, that there\\nare many plain and precious things taken away from the book,\\nwhich is the book of the Lamb of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:29\\n 29 And after these plain and precious things were taken away it\\ngoeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles; and after it\\ngoeth forth unto all the nations of the Gentiles, yea, even\\nacross the many waters which thou hast seen with the Gentiles\\nwhich have gone forth out of captivity, thou seest--because of\\nthe many plain and precious things which have been taken out of\\nthe book, which were plain unto the understanding of the children\\nof men, according to the plainness which is in the Lamb of\\nGod--because of these things which are taken away out of the\\ngospel of the Lamb, an exceedingly great many do stumble, yea,\\ninsomuch that Satan hath great power over them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:30\\n 30 Nevertheless, thou beholdest that the Gentiles who have gone\\nforth out of captivity, and have been lifted up by the power of\\nGod above all other nations, upon the face of the land which is\\nchoice above all other lands, which is the land that the Lord God\\nhath covenanted with thy father that his seed should have for the\\nland of their inheritance; wherefore, thou seest that the Lord\\nGod will not suffer that the Gentiles will utterly destroy the\\nmixture of thy seed, which are among thy brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:31\\n 31 Neither will he suffer that the Gentiles shall destroy the\\nseed of thy brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:32\\n 32 Neither will the Lord God suffer that the Gentiles shall\\nforever remain in that awful state of blindness, which thou\\nbeholdest they are in, because of the plain and most precious\\nparts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that\\nabominable church, whose formation thou hast seen.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:33\\n 33 Wherefore saith the Lamb of God: I will be merciful unto the\\nGentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel\\nin great judgment.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that the angel of the Lord spake unto me,\\nsaying: Behold, saith the Lamb of God, after I have visited the\\nremnant of the house of Israel--and this remnant of whom I speak\\nis the seed of thy father--wherefore, after I have visited them\\nin judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and\\nafter the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most\\nplain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have\\nbeen kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of\\nharlots, saith the Lamb--I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in\\nthat day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own\\npower, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious,\\nsaith the Lamb.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:35\\n 35 For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy\\nseed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister\\nunto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed\\nshall be destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of\\nthy brethren, behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth\\nunto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:36\\n 36 And in them shall be written my gospel, saith the Lamb, and\\nmy rock and my salvation.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:37\\n 37 And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at\\nthat day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy\\nGhost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at\\nthe last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of\\nthe Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great\\njoy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:38\\n 38 And it came to pass that I beheld the remnant of the seed of\\nmy brethren, and also the book of the Lamb of God, which had\\nproceeded forth from the mouth of the Jew, that it came forth\\nfrom the Gentiles unto the remnant of the seed of my brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:39\\n 39 And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books,\\nwhich came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto\\nthem, unto the convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of the\\nseed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were scattered upon\\nall the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and\\nof the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:40\\n 40 And the angel spake unto me, saying: These last records,\\nwhich thou hast seen among the Gentiles, shall establish the\\ntruth of the first, which are of the twelve apostles of the Lamb,\\nand shall make known the plain and precious things which have\\nbeen taken away from them; and shall make known to all kindreds,\\ntongues, and people, that the Lamb of God is the Son of the\\nEternal Father, and the Savior of the world; and that all men\\nmust come unto him, or they cannot be saved.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:41\\n 41 And they must come according to the words which shall be\\nestablished by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb\\nshall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the\\nrecords of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they both\\nshall be established in one; for there is one God and one\\nShepherd over all the earth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 13:42\\n 42 And the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all\\nnations, both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and after\\nhe has manifested himself unto the Jews and also unto the\\nGentiles, then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles and\\nalso unto the Jews, and the last shall be first, and the first\\nshall be last.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14\\nChapter 14\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:1\\n 1 And it shall come to pass, that if the Gentiles shall hearken\\nunto the Lamb of God in that day that he shall manifest himself\\nunto them in word, and also in power, in very deed, unto the\\ntaking away of their stumbling blocks--\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:2\\n 2 And harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, they\\nshall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall\\nbe numbered among the house of Israel; and they shall be a\\nblessed people upon the promised land forever; they shall be no\\nmore brought down into captivity; and the house of Israel shall\\nno more be confounded.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:3\\n 3 And that great pit, which hath been digged for them by that\\ngreat and abominable church, which was founded by the devil and\\nhis children, that he might lead away the souls of men down to\\nhell--yea, that great pit which hath been digged for the\\ndestruction of men shall be filled by those who digged it, unto\\ntheir utter destruction, saith the Lamb of God; not the\\ndestruction of the soul, save it be the casting of it into that\\nhell which hath no end.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:4\\n 4 For behold, this is according to the captivity of the devil,\\nand also according to the justice of God, upon all those who will\\nwork wickedness and abomination before him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi,\\nsaying: Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent it shall be\\nwell with them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of\\nthe Lord unto the house of Israel; and thou also hast heard that\\nwhoso repenteth not must perish.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:6\\n 6 Therefore, wo be unto the Gentiles if it so be that they\\nharden their hearts against the Lamb of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:7\\n 7 For the time cometh, saith the Lamb of God, that I will work a\\ngreat and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work\\nwhich shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the\\nother--either to the convincing of them unto peace and life\\neternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their\\nhearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought\\ndown into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally\\nand spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of\\nwhich I have spoken.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that when the angel had spoken these\\nwords, he said unto me: Rememberest thou the covenants of the\\nFather unto the house of Israel?  I said unto him, Yea.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look, and behold\\nthat great and abominable church, which is the mother of\\nabominations, whose founder is the devil.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:10\\n 10 And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only;\\nthe one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the\\nchurch of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church\\nof the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the\\nmother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all\\nthe earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion\\nover all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and\\npeople.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of\\nGod, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and\\nabominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless,\\nI beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God,\\nwere also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions\\nupon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness\\nof the great whore whom I saw.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of\\nabominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all\\nthe earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight\\nagainst the Lamb of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the\\nLamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of\\nthe Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were\\nscattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed\\nwith righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was\\npoured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that\\nthere were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and\\nkindreds of the earth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:16\\n 16 And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all\\nthe nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the\\nangel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the\\nmother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things--\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:17\\n 17 And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out\\nupon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable\\nchurch of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at\\nthat day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the\\nway for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to\\nhis people who are of the house of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying:\\nLook!\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:19\\n 19 And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white\\nrobe.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:20\\n 20 And the angel said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles\\nof the Lamb.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:21\\n 21 Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things;\\nyea, and also many things which have been.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:22\\n 22 And he shall also write concerning the end of the world.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:23\\n 23 Wherefore, the things which he shall write are just and true;\\nand behold they are written in the book which thou beheld\\nproceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they\\nproceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book\\nproceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were\\nwritten were plain and pure, and most precious and easy to the\\nunderstanding of all men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:24\\n 24 And behold, the things which this apostle of the Lamb shall\\nwrite are many things which thou hast seen; and behold, the\\nremainder shalt thou see.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:25\\n 25 But the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not\\nwrite; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of\\nGod that he should write them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:26\\n 26 And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all\\nthings, and they have written them; and they are sealed up to\\ncome forth in their purity, according to the truth which is in\\nthe Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of\\nIsrael.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:27\\n 27 And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the\\napostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:28\\n 28 And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the\\nremainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the\\nthings which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but\\na small part of the things which I saw.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:29\\n 29 And I bear record that I saw the things which my father saw,\\nand the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 14:30\\n 30 And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which\\nI saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the\\nthings which I saw are not written, the things which I have\\nwritten are true.  And thus it is.  Amen.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15\\nChapter 15\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been carried away\\nin the spirit, and seen all these things, I returned to the tent\\nof my father.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that I beheld my brethren, and they were\\ndisputing one with another concerning the things my father had\\nspoken unto them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:3\\n 3 For he truly spake many great things unto them, which were\\nhard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and\\nthey being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto\\nthe Lord as they ought.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:4\\n 4 And now I, Nephi, was grieved because of the hardness of their\\nhearts, and also, because of the things which I had seen, and\\nknew they must unavoidably come to pass because of the great\\nwickedness of the children of men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that I was overcome because of my\\nafflictions, for I considered that mine afflictions were great\\nabove all, because of the destruction of my people, for I had\\nbeheld their fall.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that after I had received strength I spake\\nunto my brethren, desiring to know of them the cause of their\\ndisputations.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:7\\n 7 And they said: Behold, we cannot understand the words which\\nour father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the\\nolive-tree, and also concerning the Gentiles.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:8\\n 8 And I said unto them: Have ye inquired of the Lord?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:9\\n 9 And they said unto me: We have not; for the Lord maketh no\\nsuch thing known unto us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:10\\n 10 Behold, I said unto them: How is it that ye do not keep the\\ncommandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because\\nof the hardness of your hearts?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:11\\n 11 Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If\\nye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing\\nthat ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments,\\nsurely these things shall be made known unto you.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:12\\n 12 Behold, I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared\\nunto an olive-tree, by the Spirit of the Lord which was in our\\nfather; and behold are we not broken off from the house of\\nIsrael, and are we not a branch of the house of Israel?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:13\\n 13 And now, the thing which our father meaneth concerning the\\ngrafting in of the natural branches through the fulness of the\\nGentiles, is, that in the latter days, when our seed shall have\\ndwindled in unbelief, yea, for the space of many years, and many\\ngenerations after the Messiah shall be manifested in body unto\\nthe children of men, then shall the fulness of the gospel of the\\nMessiah come unto the Gentiles, and from the Gentiles unto the\\nremnant of our seed--\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:14\\n 14 And at that day shall the remnant of our seed know that they\\nare of the house of Israel, and that they are the covenant people\\nof the Lord; and then shall they know and come to the knowledge\\nof their forefathers, and also to the knowledge of the gospel of\\ntheir Redeemer, which was ministered unto their fathers by him;\\nwherefore, they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer and\\nthe very points of his doctrine, that they may know how to come\\nunto him and be saved.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:15\\n 15 And then at that day will they not rejoice and give praise\\nunto their everlasting God, their rock and their salvation? Yea,\\nat that day, will they not receive the strength and nourishment\\nfrom the true vine? Yea, will they not come unto the true fold of\\nGod?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:16\\n 16 Behold, I say unto you, Yea; they shall be remembered again\\namong the house of Israel; they shall be grafted in, being a\\nnatural branch of the olive-tree, into the true olive-tree.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:17\\n 17 And this is what our father meaneth; and he meaneth that it\\nwill not come to pass until after they are scattered by the\\nGentiles; and he meaneth that it shall come by way of the\\nGentiles, that the Lord may show his power unto the Gentiles, for\\nthe very cause that he shall be rejected of the Jews, or of the\\nhouse of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:18\\n 18 Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but\\nalso of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which\\nshould be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord\\nmade to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the\\nkindreds of the earth be blessed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them\\nconcerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the\\nrestoration of the Jews in the latter days.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:20\\n 20 And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who spake\\nconcerning the restoration of the Jews, or of the house of\\nIsrael; and after they were restored they should no more be\\nconfounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came\\nto pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they\\nwere pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that they did speak unto me again,\\nsaying: What meaneth this thing which our father saw in a dream?\\nWhat meaneth the tree which he saw?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:22\\n 22 And I said unto them: It was a representation of the tree of\\nlife.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:23\\n 23 And they said unto me: What meaneth the rod of iron which our\\nfather saw, that led to the tree?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:24\\n 24 And I said unto them that it was the word of God, and whose\\nwould hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it,\\nthey would never perish; neither could the temptations and the\\nfiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to\\nlead them away to destruction.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:25\\n 25 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the\\nword of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of\\nmy soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they\\nwould give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his\\ncommandments always in all things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:26\\n 26 And they said unto me: What meaneth the river of water which\\nour father saw?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:27\\n 27 And I said unto them that the water which my father saw was\\nfilthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things\\nthat he beheld not the filthiness of the water.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:28\\n 28 And I said unto them that it was an awful gulf, which\\nseparated the wicked from the tree of life, and also from the\\nsaints of God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:29\\n 29 And I said unto them that it was a representation of that\\nawful hell, which the angel said unto me was prepared for the\\nwicked.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:30\\n 30 And I said unto them that our father also saw that the\\njustice of God did also divide the wicked from the righteous; and\\nthe brightness thereof was like unto the brightness of a flaming\\nfire, which ascendeth up unto God forever and ever, and hath no\\nend.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:31\\n 31 And they said unto me: Doth this thing mean the torment of\\nthe body in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final\\nstate of the soul after the death of the temporal body, or doth\\nit speak of the things which are temporal?\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that I said unto them that it was a\\nrepresentation of things both temporal and spiritual; for the day\\nshould come that they must be judged of their works, yea, even\\nthe works which were done by the temporal body in their days of\\nprobation.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:33\\n 33 Wherefore, if they should die in their wickedness they must\\nbe cast off also, as to the things which are spiritual, which are\\npertaining to righteousness; wherefore, they must be brought to\\nstand before God, to be judged of their works; and if their works\\nhave been filthiness they must needs be filthy; and if they be\\nfilthy it must needs be that they cannot dwell in the kingdom of\\nGod; if so, the kingdom of God must be filthy also.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:34\\n 34 But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy,\\nand there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God;\\nwherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for\\nthat which is filthy.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:35\\n 35 And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful hell of\\nwhich I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it;\\nwherefore the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the\\nkingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that justice of\\nwhich I have spoken.\\n\\n1 Nephi 15:36\\n 36 Wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and\\nalso from that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and\\nmost desirable above all other fruits; yea, and it is the\\ngreatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spake unto my\\nbrethren. Amen.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16\\nChapter 16\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end\\nof speaking to my brethren, behold they said unto me: Thou hast\\ndeclared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I\\nhad spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the\\ntruth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that\\nthey should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty\\ntaketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very\\ncenter.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:3\\n 3 And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to\\nhearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk\\nuprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the\\ntruth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did exhort my brethren,\\nwith all diligence, to keep the commandments of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that they did humble themselves before the\\nLord; insomuch that I had joy and great hopes of them, that they\\nwould walk in the paths of righteousness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:6\\n 6 Now, all these things were said and done as my father dwelt in\\na tent in the valley which he called Lemuel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, took one of the daughters\\nof Ishmael to wife; and also, my brethren took of the daughters\\nof Ishmael to wife; and also Zoram took the eldest daughter of\\nIshmael to wife.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:8\\n 8 And thus my father had fulfilled all the commandments of the\\nLord which had been given unto him.  And also, I, Nephi, had been\\nblessed of the Lord exceedingly.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord spake unto my\\nfather by night, and commanded him that on the morrow he should\\ntake his journey into the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that as my father arose in the morning,\\nand went forth to the tent door, to his great astonishment he\\nbeheld upon the ground a round ball of curious workmanship; and\\nit was of fine brass.  And within the ball were two spindles; and\\nthe one pointed the way whither we should go into the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that we did gather together whatsoever\\nthings we should carry into the wilderness, and all the remainder\\nof our provisions which the Lord had given unto us; and we did\\ntake seed of every kind that we might carry into the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that we did take our tents and depart\\ninto the wilderness, across the river Laman.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that we traveled for the space of four\\ndays, nearly a south-southeast direction, and we did pitch our\\ntents again; and we did call the name of the place Shazer.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that we did take our bows and our arrows,\\nand go forth into the wilderness to slay food for our families;\\nand after we had slain food for our families we did return again\\nto our families in the wilderness, to the place of Shazer.  And\\nwe did go forth again in the wilderness, following the same\\ndirection, keeping in the most fertile parts of the wilderness,\\nwhich were in the borders near the Red Sea.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many\\ndays, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and\\nour stones and our slings.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:16\\n 16 And we did follow the directions of the ball, which led us in\\nthe more fertile parts of the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:17\\n 17 And after we had traveled for the space of many days, we did\\npitch our tents for the space of a time, that we might again rest\\nourselves and obtain food for our families.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that as I, Nephi, went forth to slay\\nfood, behold, I did break my bow, which was made of fine steel;\\nand after I did break my bow, behold, my brethren were angry with\\nme because of the loss of my bow, for we did obtain no food.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that we did return without food to our\\nfamilies, and being much fatigued, because of their journeying,\\nthey did suffer much for the want of food.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel and the sons of\\nIshmael did begin to murmur exceedingly, because of their\\nsufferings and afflictions in the wilderness; and also my father\\nbegan to murmur against the Lord his God; yea, and they were all\\nexceedingly sorrowful, even that they did murmur against the\\nLord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:21\\n 21 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, having been afflicted with\\nmy brethren because of the loss of my bow, and their bows having\\nlost their springs, it began to be exceedingly difficult, yea,\\ninsomuch that we could obtain no food.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did speak much unto my\\nbrethren, because they had hardened their hearts again, even unto\\ncomplaining against the Lord their God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a\\nbow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm\\nmyself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. \\nAnd I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they\\nhad humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many\\nthings unto them in the energy of my soul.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my\\nfather; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring\\nagainst the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the\\ndepths of sorrow.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him:\\nLook upon the ball, and behold the things which are written.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things\\nwhich were written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble\\nexceedingly, and also my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and our\\nwives.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which\\nwere in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and\\ndiligence and heed which we did give unto them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:29\\n 29 And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was\\nplain to be read, which did give us understanding concerning the\\nways of the Lord; and it was written and changed from time to\\ntime, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it.\\n\\nAnd thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about\\ngreat things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the\\ntop of the mountain, according to the directions which were given\\nupon the ball.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that I did slay wild beasts, insomuch\\nthat I did obtain food for our families.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that I did return to our tents, bearing\\nthe beasts which I had slain; and now when they beheld that I had\\nobtained food, how great was their joy!  And it came to pass that\\nthey did humble themselves before the Lord, and did give thanks\\nunto him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey,\\ntraveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after\\nwe had traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents\\nagain, that we might tarry for the space of a time.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the\\nplace which was called Nahom.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn\\nexceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of\\ntheir afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against\\nmy father, because he had brought them out of the land of\\nJerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered\\nmuch in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction,\\nhunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we\\nmust perish in the wilderness with hunger.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:36\\n 36 And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against\\nme; and they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:37\\n 37 And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael:\\nBehold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who\\nhas taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are\\nhis elder brethren.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:38\\n 38 Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that\\nangels have ministered unto him.  But behold, we know that he\\nlies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many\\nthings by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes,\\nthinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange\\nwilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make\\nhimself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us\\naccording to his will and pleasure.  And after this manner did my\\nbrother Laman stir up their hearts to anger.\\n\\n1 Nephi 16:39\\n 39 And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the\\nvoice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and\\ndid chasten them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by\\nthe voice of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and did\\nrepent of their sins, insomuch that the Lord did bless us again\\nwith food, that we did not perish.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17\\nChapter 17\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the\\nwilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward from that time\\nforth.  And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the\\nwilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:2\\n 2 And so great were the blessings of the Lord upon us, that\\nwhile we did live upon raw meat in the wilderness, our women did\\ngive plenty of suck for their children, and were strong, yea,\\neven like unto the men; and they began to bear their journeyings\\nwithout murmurings.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:3\\n 3 And thus we see that the commandments of God must be\\nfulfilled.  And if it so be that the children of men keep the\\ncommandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them,\\nand provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he\\nhas commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while\\nwe did sojourn in the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:4\\n 4 And we did sojourn for the space of many years, yea, even\\neight years in the wilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:5\\n 5 And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because\\nof its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things were\\nprepared of the Lord that we might not perish.  And we beheld the\\nsea, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many\\nwaters.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the\\nseashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions\\nand much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them\\nall, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore;\\nand we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had been in the land\\nof Bountiful for the space of many days, the voice of the Lord\\ncame unto me, saying: Arise, and get thee into the mountain.  And\\nit came to pass that I arose and went up into the mountain, and\\ncried unto the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Thou\\nshalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee,\\nthat I may carry thy people across these waters.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:9\\n 9 And I said: Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to\\nmolten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the\\nmanner which thou hast shown unto me?\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the Lord told me whither I should go\\nto find ore, that I might make tools.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows\\nwherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I\\nhad made a bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire,\\nI did smite two stones together that I might make fire.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:12\\n 12 For the Lord had not hitherto suffered that we should make\\nmuch fire, as we journeyed in the wilderness; for he said: I will\\nmake thy food become sweet, that ye cook it not;\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:13\\n 13 And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will\\nprepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my\\ncommandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my\\ncommandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye\\nshall know that it is by me that ye are led.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:14\\n 14 Yea, and the Lord said also that: After ye have arrived in\\nthe promised land, ye shall know that I, the Lord, am God; and\\nthat I, the Lord, did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I\\ndid bring you out of the land of Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:15\\n 15 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did strive to keep the commandments of\\nthe Lord, and I did exhort my brethren to faithfulness and\\ndiligence.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that I did make tools of the ore which I\\ndid molten out of the rock.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:17\\n 17 And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship,\\nthey began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool,\\nfor he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also\\nthinketh that he can cross these great waters.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:18\\n 18 And thus my brethren did complain against me, and were\\ndesirous that they might not labor, for they did not believe that\\nI could build a ship; neither would they believe that I was\\ninstructed of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:19\\n 19 And now it came to pass that I, Nephi, was exceedingly\\nsorrowful because of the hardness of their hearts; and now when\\nthey saw that I began to be sorrowful they were glad in their\\nhearts, insomuch that they did rejoice over me, saying: We knew\\nthat ye could not construct a ship, for we knew that ye were\\nlacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so\\ngreat a work.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:20\\n 20 And thou art like unto our father, led away by the foolish\\nimaginations of his heart; yea, he hath led us out of the land of\\nJerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many\\nyears; and our women have toiled, being big with child; and they\\nhave borne children in the wilderness and suffered all things,\\nsave it were death; and it would have been better that they had\\ndied before they came out of Jerusalem than to have suffered\\nthese afflictions.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:21\\n 21 Behold, these many years we have suffered in the wilderness,\\nwhich time we might have enjoyed our possessions and the land of\\nour inheritance; yea, and we might have been happy.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:22\\n 22 And we know that the people who were in the land of Jerusalem\\nwere a righteous people; for they kept the statutes and judgments\\nof the Lord, and all his commandments, according to the law of\\nMoses; wherefore, we know that they are a righteous people; and\\nour father hath judged them, and hath led us away because we\\nwould hearken unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto\\nhim.  And after this manner of language did my brethren murmur\\nand complain against us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake unto them, saying:\\nDo ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel,\\nwould have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if\\nthey had not hearkened unto the words of the Lord?\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:24\\n 24 Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been led out of\\nbondage, if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should lead\\nthem out of bondage?\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:25\\n 25 Now ye know that the children of Israel were in bondage; and\\nye know that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to\\nbe borne; wherefore, ye know that it must needs be a good thing\\nfor them, that they should be brought out of bondage.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:26\\n 26 Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that\\ngreat work; and ye know that by his word the waters of the Red\\nSea were divided hither and thither, and they passed through on\\ndry ground.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:27\\n 27 But ye know that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea,\\nwho were the armies of Pharaoh.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:28\\n 28 And ye also know that they were fed with manna in the\\nwilderness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:29\\n 29 Yea, and ye also know that Moses, by his word according to\\nthe power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came\\nforth water, that the children of Israel might quench their\\nthirst.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:30\\n 30 And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their\\nRedeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light\\nunto them by night, and doing all things for them which were\\nexpedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and\\nblinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the\\ntrue and living God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that according to his word he did destroy\\nthem; and according to his word he did lead them; and according\\nto his word he did do all things for them; and there was not any\\nthing done save it were by his word.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:32\\n 32 And after they had crossed the river Jordan he did make them\\nmighty unto the driving out of the children of the land, yea,\\nunto the scattering them to destruction.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:33\\n 33 And now, do ye suppose that the children of this land, who\\nwere in the land of promise, who were driven out by our fathers,\\ndo ye suppose that they were righteous?  Behold, I say unto you,\\nNay.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:34\\n 34 Do ye suppose that our fathers would have been more choice\\nthan they if they had been righteous?  I say unto you, Nay.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:35\\n 35 Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is\\nrighteous is favored of God.  But behold, this people had\\nrejected every word of God, and they were ripe in iniquity; and\\nthe fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did\\ncurse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea,\\nhe did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did\\nbless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining power over it.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:36\\n 36 Behold, the Lord hath created the earth that it should be\\ninhabited; and he hath created his children that they should\\npossess it.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:37\\n 37 And he raiseth up a righteous nation, and destroyeth the\\nnations of the wicked.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:38\\n 38 And he leadeth away the righteous into precious lands, and\\nthe wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for\\ntheir sakes.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:39\\n 39 He ruleth high in the heavens, for it is his throne, and this\\nearth is his footstool.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:40\\n 40 And he loveth those who will have him to be their God. \\nBehold, he loved our fathers, and he covenanted with them, yea,\\neven Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants\\nwhich he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land\\nof Egypt.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:41\\n 41 And he did straiten them in the wilderness with his rod; for\\nthey hardened their hearts, even as ye have; and the Lord\\nstraitened them because of their iniquity.  He sent fiery flying\\nserpents among them; and after they were bitten he prepared a way\\nthat they might be healed; and the labor which they had to\\nperform was to look; and because of the simpleness of the way, or\\nthe easiness of it, there were many who perished.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:42\\n 42 And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they\\ndid revile against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, ye\\nknow that they were led forth by his matchless power into the\\nland of promise.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:43\\n 43 And now, after all these things, the time has come that they\\nhave become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and I know not but\\nthey are at this day about to be destroyed; for I know that the\\nday must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a few\\nonly, who shall be led away into captivity.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:44\\n 44 Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he should depart\\ninto the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his\\nlife; yea, and ye also have sought to take away his life;\\nwherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts and ye are like unto\\nthem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:45\\n 45 Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord\\nyour God.  Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye\\nhave heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto\\nyou in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that ye\\ncould not feel his words; wherefore, he has spoken unto you like\\nunto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as\\nif it were to divide asunder.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:46\\n 46 And ye also know that by the power of his almighty word he\\ncan cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know\\nthat by his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth,\\nand smooth places shall be broken up.  O, then, why is it, that\\nye can be so hard in your hearts?\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:47\\n 47 Behold, my soul is rent with anguish because of you, and my\\nheart is pained; I fear lest ye shall be cast off forever. \\nBehold, I am full of the Spirit of God, insomuch that my frame\\nhas no strength.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:48\\n 48 And now it came to pass that when I had spoken these words,\\nthey were angry with me, and were desirous to throw me into the\\ndepths of the sea; and as they came forth to lay their hands upon\\nme I spake unto them, saying: In the name of the Almighty God, I\\ncommand you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power\\nof God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay\\nhis hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall\\nbe as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:49\\n 49 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they\\nshould murmur no more against their father; neither should they\\nwithhold their labor from me, for God had commanded me that I\\nshould build a ship.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:50\\n 50 And I said unto them: If God had commanded me to do all\\nthings I could do them.  If he should command me that I should\\nsay unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I\\nshould say it, it would be done.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:51\\n 51 And now, if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so\\nmany miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot\\ninstruct me, that I should build a ship?\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:52\\n 52 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said many things unto my\\nbrethren, insomuch that they were confounded and could not\\ncontend against me; neither durst they lay their hands upon me\\nnor touch me with their fingers, even for the space of many days.\\n\\nNow they durst not do this lest they should wither before me, so\\npowerful was the Spirit of God; and thus it had wrought upon\\nthem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:53\\n 53 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth\\nthine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither\\nbefore thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord, and this will\\nI do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:54\\n 54 And it came to pass that I stretched forth my hand unto my\\nbrethren, and they did not wither before me; but the Lord did\\nshake them, even according to the word which he had spoken.\\n\\n1 Nephi 17:55\\n 55 And now, they said: We know of a surety that the Lord is with\\nthee, for we know that it is the power of the Lord that has\\nshaken us.  And they fell down before me, and were about to\\nworship me, but I would not suffer them, saying: I am thy\\nbrother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the\\nLord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days\\nmay be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18\\nChapter 18\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go\\nforth with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship. \\nAnd the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I\\nshould work the timbers of the ship.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:2\\n 2 Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which\\nwas learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner\\nof men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had\\nshown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:3\\n 3 And I, Nephi, did go into the mount oft, and I did pray oft\\nunto the Lord; wherefore the Lord showed unto me great things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that after I had finished the ship,\\naccording to the word of the Lord, my brethren beheld that it was\\ngood, and that the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine;\\nwherefore, they did humble themselves again before the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my\\nfather, that we should arise and go down into the ship.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that on the morrow, after we had prepared\\nall things, much fruits and meat from the wilderness, and honey\\nin abundance, and provisions according to that which the Lord had\\ncommanded us, we did go down into the ship, with all our loading\\nand our seeds, and whatsoever thing we had brought with us, every\\none according to his age; wherefore, we did all go down into the\\nship, with our wives and our children.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:7\\n 7 And now, my father had begat two sons in the wilderness; the\\nelder was called Jacob and the younger Joseph.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:8\\n 8 And it came to pass after we had all gone down into the ship,\\nand had taken with us our provisions and things which had been\\ncommanded us, we did put forth into the sea and were driven forth\\nbefore the wind towards the promised land.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:9\\n 9 And after we had been driven forth before the wind for the\\nspace of many days, behold, my brethren and the sons of Ishmael\\nand also their wives began to make themselves merry, insomuch\\nthat they began to dance, and to sing, and to speak with much\\nrudeness, yea, even that they did forget by what power they had\\nbeen brought thither; yea, they were lifted up unto exceeding\\nrudeness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:10\\n 10 And I, Nephi, began to fear exceedingly lest the Lord should\\nbe angry with us, and smite us because of our iniquity, that we\\nshould be swallowed up in the depths of the sea; wherefore, I,\\nNephi, began to speak to them with much soberness; but behold\\nthey were angry with me, saying: We will not that our younger\\nbrother shall be a ruler over us.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and\\nbind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness;\\nnevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his\\npower, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken\\nconcerning the wicked.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that after they had bound me insomuch\\nthat I could not move, the compass, which had been prepared of\\nthe Lord, did cease to work.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:13\\n 13 Wherefore, they knew not whither they should steer the ship,\\ninsomuch that there arose a great storm, yea, a great and\\nterrible tempest, and we were driven back upon the waters for the\\nspace of three days; and they began to be frightened exceedingly\\nlest they should be drowned in the sea; nevertheless they did not\\nloose me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:14\\n 14 And on the fourth day, which we had been driven back, the\\ntempest began to be exceedingly sore.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that we were about to be swallowed up in\\nthe depths of the sea.  And after we had been driven back upon\\nthe waters for the space of four days, my brethren began to see\\nthat the judgments of God were upon them, and that they must\\nperish save that they should repent of their iniquities;\\nwherefore, they came unto me, and loosed the bands which were\\nupon my wrist, and behold they had swollen exceedingly; and also\\nmine ankles were much swollen, and great was the soreness\\nthereof.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:16\\n 16 Nevertheless, I did look unto my God, and I did praise him\\nall the day long; and I did not murmur against the Lord because\\nof mine afflictions.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:17\\n 17 Now my father, Lehi, had said many things unto them, and also\\nunto the sons of Ishmael; but, behold, they did breathe out much\\nthreatenings against anyone that should speak for me; and my\\nparents being stricken in years, and having suffered much grief\\nbecause of their children, they were brought down, yea, even upon\\ntheir sick-beds.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:18\\n 18 Because of their grief and much sorrow, and the iniquity of\\nmy brethren, they were brought near even to be carried out of\\nthis time to meet their God; yea, their grey hairs were about to\\nbe brought down to lie low in the dust; yea, even they were near\\nto be cast with sorrow into a watery grave.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:19\\n 19 And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much\\nnourishment, were grieved because of the afflictions of their\\nmother; and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my\\nchildren, did not soften the hearts of my brethren that they\\nwould loose me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:20\\n 20 And there was nothing save it were the power of God, which\\nthreatened them with destruction, could soften their hearts;\\nwherefore, when they saw that they were about to be swallowed up\\nin the depths of the sea they repented of the thing which they\\nhad done, insomuch that they loosed me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:21\\n 21 And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took\\nthe compass, and it did work whither I desired it.  And it came\\nto pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the\\nwinds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great\\ncalm.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did guide the ship, that\\nwe sailed again towards the promised land.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of\\nmany days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth\\nupon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the\\npromised land.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and\\nwe began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the\\nearth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem.  And it\\ncame to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were\\nblessed in abundance.\\n\\n1 Nephi 18:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that we did find upon the land of\\npromise, as we journeyed in the wilderness, that there were\\nbeasts in the forests of every kind, both the cow and the ox, and\\nthe ass and the horse, and the goat and the wild goat, and all\\nmanner of wild animals, which were for the use of men.  And we\\ndid find all manner of ore, both of gold, and of silver, and of\\ncopper.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19\\nChapter 19\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I\\ndid make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record\\nof my people.  And upon the plates which I made I did engraven\\nthe record of my father, and also our journeyings in the\\nwilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of\\nmine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:2\\n 2 And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be\\ncommanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record\\nof my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part\\nof all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those\\nfirst plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which\\ntranspired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more\\nparticularly made mention upon the first plates.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:3\\n 3 And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I,\\nNephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the\\nprophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be\\nwritten upon these plates; and that the things which were written\\nshould be kept for the instruction of my people, who should\\npossess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which\\npurposes are known unto the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:4\\n 4 Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates,\\nwhich gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the\\nwars and contentions and destructions of my people.  And this\\nhave I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I\\nwas gone; and that these plates should be handed down from one\\ngeneration to another, or from one prophet to another, until\\nfurther commandments of the Lord.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:5\\n 5 And an account of my making these plates shall be given\\nhereafter; and then, behold, I proceed according to that which I\\nhave spoken; and this I do that the more sacred things may be\\nkept for the knowledge of my people.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:6\\n 6 Nevertheless, I do not write anything upon plates save it be\\nthat I think it be sacred.  And now, if I do err, even did they\\nerr of old; not that I would excuse myself because of other men,\\nbut because of the weakness which is in me, according to the\\nflesh, I would excuse myself.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:7\\n 7 For the things which some men esteem to be of great worth,\\nboth to the body and soul, others set at naught and trample under\\ntheir feet.  Yea, even the very God of Israel do men trample\\nunder their feet; I say, trample under their feet but I would\\nspeak in other words--they set him at naught, and hearken not to\\nthe voice of his counsels.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:8\\n 8 And behold he cometh, according to the words of the angel, in\\nsix hundred years from the time my father left Jerusalem.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:9\\n 9 And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to\\nbe a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he\\nsuffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it.  Yea, they\\nspit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving\\nkindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:10\\n 10 And the God of our fathers, who were led out of Egypt, out of\\nbondage, and also were preserved in the wilderness by him, yea,\\nthe God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, yieldeth\\nhimself, according to the words of the angel, as a man, into the\\nhands of wicked men, to be lifted up, according to the words of\\nZenock, and to be crucified, according to the words of Neum, and\\nto be buried in a sepulchre, according to the words of Zenos,\\nwhich he spake concerning the three days of darkness, which\\nshould be a sign given of his death unto those who should inhabit\\nthe isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of\\nthe house of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:11\\n 11 For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit\\nall the house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because\\nof their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and\\nothers with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by\\ntempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the\\nopening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:12\\n 12 And all these things must surely come, saith the prophet\\nZenos.  And the rocks of the earth must rend; and because of the\\ngroanings of the earth, many of the kings of the isles of the sea\\nshall be wrought upon by the Spirit of God, to exclaim: The God\\nof nature suffers.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:13\\n 13 And as for those who are at Jerusalem, saith the prophet,\\nthey shall be scourged by all people, because they crucify the\\nGod of Israel, and turn their hearts aside, rejecting signs and\\nwonders, and the power and glory of the God of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:14\\n 14 And because they turn their hearts aside, saith the prophet,\\nand have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in\\nthe flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be\\nhated among all nations.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:15\\n 15 Nevertheless, when that day cometh, saith the prophet, that\\nthey no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of\\nIsrael, then will he remember the covenants which he made to\\ntheir fathers.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:16\\n 16 Yea, then will he remember the isles of the sea; yea, and all\\nthe people who are of the house of Israel, will I gather in,\\nsaith the Lord, according to the words of the prophet Zenos, from\\nthe four quarters of the earth.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:17\\n 17 Yea, and all the earth shall see the salvation of the Lord,\\nsaith the prophet; every nation, kindred, tongue and people shall\\nbe blessed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:18\\n 18 And I, Nephi, have written these things unto my people, that\\nperhaps I might persuade them that they would remember the Lord\\ntheir Redeemer.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:19\\n 19 Wherefore, I speak unto all the house of Israel, if it so be\\nthat they should obtain these things.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:20\\n 20 For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary\\nme even that all my joints are weak, for those who are at\\nJerusalem; for had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me\\nconcerning them, even as he had prophets of old, I should have\\nperished also.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:21\\n 21 And he surely did show unto the prophets of old all things\\nconcerning them; and also he did show unto many concerning us;\\nwherefore, it must needs be that we know concerning them for they\\nare written upon the plates of brass.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:22\\n 22 Now it came to pass that I, Nephi, did teach my brethren\\nthese things; and it came to pass that I did read many things to\\nthem, which were engraven upon the plates of brass, that they\\nmight know concerning the doings of the Lord in other lands,\\namong people of old.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:23\\n 23 And I did read many things unto them which were written in\\nthe books of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to\\nbelieve in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that\\nwhich was written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all\\nscriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning.\\n\\n1 Nephi 19:24\\n 24 Wherefore I spake unto them, saying: Hear ye the words of the\\nprophet, ye who are a remnant of the house of Israel, a branch\\nwho have been broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which\\nwere written unto all the house of Israel, and liken them unto\\nyourselves, that ye may have hope as well as your brethren from\\nwhom ye have been broken off; for after this manner has the\\nprophet written.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20\\nChapter 20\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:1\\n 1 Hearken and hear this, O house of Jacob, who are called by the\\nname of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, or\\nout of the waters of baptism, who swear by the name of the Lord,\\nand make mention of the God of Israel, yet they swear not in\\ntruth nor in righteousness.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:2\\n 2 Nevertheless, they call themselves of the holy city, but they\\ndo not stay themselves upon the God of Israel, who is the Lord of\\nHosts; yea, the Lord of Hosts is his name.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:3\\n 3 Behold, I have declared the former things from the beginning;\\nand they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them.  I did\\nshow them suddenly.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:4\\n 4 And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy\\nneck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:5\\n 5 And I have even from the beginning declared to thee; before it\\ncame to pass I showed them thee; and I showed them for fear lest\\nthou shouldst say--mine idol hath done them, and my graven image,\\nand my molten image hath commanded them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:6\\n 6 Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare\\nthem?  And that I have showed thee new things from this time,\\neven hidden things, and thou didst not know them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:7\\n 7 They are created now, and not from the beginning, even before\\nthe day when thou heardest them not they were declared unto thee,\\nlest thou shouldst say--Behold I knew them.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:8\\n 8 Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from\\nthat time thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldst\\ndeal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the\\nwomb.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:9\\n 9 Nevertheless, for my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and\\nfor my praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:10\\n 10 For, behold, I have refined thee, I have chosen thee in the\\nfurnace of affliction.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:11\\n 11 For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will I do this, for\\nI will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my\\nglory unto another.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:12\\n 12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called, for I am he;\\nI am the first, and I am also the last.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:13\\n 13 Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my\\nright hand hath spanned the heavens.  I call unto them and they\\nstand up together.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:14\\n 14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath\\ndeclared these things unto them?  The Lord hath loved him; yea,\\nand he will fulfill his word which he hath declared by them; and\\nhe will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come upon\\nthe Chaldeans.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:15\\n 15 Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, yea, I have spoken; yea, I\\nhave called him to declare, I have brought him, and he shall make\\nhis way prosperous.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:16\\n 16 Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret; from the\\nbeginning, from the time that it was declared have I spoken; and\\nthe Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:17\\n 17 And thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of\\nIsrael; I have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to\\nprofit, who leadeth thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done\\nit.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:18\\n 18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments--then had thy\\npeace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the\\nsea.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:19\\n 19 Thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy\\nbowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut\\noff nor destroyed from before me.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:20\\n 20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a\\nvoice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter to the end of the\\nearth; say ye: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:21\\n 21 And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts; he\\ncaused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the\\nrock also and the waters gushed out.\\n\\n1 Nephi 20:22\\n 22 And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also,\\nthere is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.\\n\\n1 Nephi 21\\nChapter 21\\n\\n1 Nephi 21:1\\n 1 And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are\\nbroken off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the\\npastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that are\\nscattered abroad, who are of my people, O house of Israel. \\nListen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from far; the\\nLord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother\\nhath he made mention of my name.\\n\\n1 Nephi 21:2\\n 2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of\\nhis hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his\\nquiver hath he hid me;\\n\\n1 Nephi 21:3\\n 3 And said unto me: Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I\\nwill be glorified.\\n\\n1 Nephi 21:4\\n 4 Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength\\nfor naught and in vain; surely my judgment is with the Lord, and\\nmy work with my God.\\n\\n1 Nephi 21:5\\n 5 And now, saith the Lord--that formed me from the womb that I\\nshould be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him--though Israel\\nbe not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord,\\nand my God shall be my strength.\\n\\n1 Nephi 21:6\\n 6 And he said: It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my\\nservant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the\\npreserved of Israel.

Behold, are they to be understood according to things\\nwhich are spiritual, which shall come to pass according to the\\nspirit and not the flesh?\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:2\\n 2 And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto\\nthe prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all\\nthings made known unto the prophets, which shall come upon the\\nchildren of men according to the flesh.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:3\\n 3 Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things\\npertaining to things both temporal and spiritual; for it appears\\nthat the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon\\nall the face of the earth, and also among all nations.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:4\\n 4 And behold, there are many who are already lost from the\\nknowledge of those who are at Jerusalem.  Yea, the more part of\\nall the tribes have been led away; and they are scattered to and\\nfro upon the isles of the sea; and whither they are none of us\\nknoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:5\\n 5 And since they have been led away, these things have been\\nprophesied concerning them, and also concerning all those who\\nshall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the\\nHoly One of Israel; for against him will they harden their\\nhearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all nations and\\nshall be hated of all men.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:6\\n 6 Nevertheless, after they shall be nursed by the Gentiles, and\\nthe Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up\\nfor a standard, and their children have been carried in their\\narms, and their daughters have been carried upon their shoulders,\\nbehold these things of which are spoken are temporal; for thus\\nare the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us\\nin the days to come, and also all our brethren who are of the\\nhouse of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:7\\n 7 And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house\\nof Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God\\nwill raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon\\nthe face of this land; and by them shall our seed be scattered.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:8\\n 8 And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to\\ndo a marvelous work among the Gentiles, which shall be of great\\nworth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being\\nnourished by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms and\\nupon their shoulders.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:9\\n 9 And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only\\nunto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the\\nmaking known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto\\nAbraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth\\nbe blessed.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:10\\n 10 And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the\\nkindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare\\nhis arm in the eyes of the nations.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:11\\n 11 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in\\nthe eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and\\nhis gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:12\\n 12 Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and\\nthey shall be gathered together to the lands of their\\ninheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out\\nof darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior\\nand their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:13\\n 13 And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is\\nthe whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for\\nthey shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands\\nshall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with\\ntheir own blood.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:14\\n 14 And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of\\nIsrael, shall be turned one against another, and they shall fall\\ninto the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord.\\n\\nAnd all that fight against Zion shall be destroyed, and that\\ngreat whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea,\\nthat great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust and\\ngreat shall be the fall of it.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:15\\n 15 For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh speedily that\\nSatan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of\\nmen; for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do\\nwickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must\\nbe burned.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:16\\n 16 For the time soon cometh that the fulness of the wrath of God\\nshall be poured out upon all the children of men; for he will not\\nsuffer that the wicked shall destroy the righteous.\\n\\n1 Nephi 22:17\\n 17 Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even\\nif it so be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the\\nrighteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their\\nenemies by fire.

Amen.\\n\\n2 Nephi\\nTHE SECOND BOOK OF NEPHI\\nAn account of the death of Lehi.  Nephi's brethren rebel against\\nhim.  The Lord warns Nephi to depart into the wilderness.  His\\njourneyings in the wilderness, and so forth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had made an end\\nof teaching my brethren, our father, Lehi, also spake many things\\nunto them, and rehearsed unto them, how great things the Lord had\\ndone for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:2\\n 2 And he spake unto them concerning their rebellions upon the\\nwaters, and the mercies of God in sparing their lives, that they\\nwere not swallowed up in the sea.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:3\\n 3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise,\\nwhich they had obtained--how merciful the Lord had been in\\nwarning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:4\\n 4 For, behold, said he, I have seen a vision, in which I know\\nthat Jerusalem is destroyed; and had we remained in Jerusalem we\\nshould also have perished.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:5\\n 5 But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have\\nobtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all\\nother lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me\\nshould be a land for the inheritance of my seed.  Yea, the Lord\\nhath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever,\\nand also all those who should be led out of other countries by\\nthe hand of the Lord.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:6\\n 6 Wherefore, I, Lehi, prophesy according to the workings of the\\nSpirit which is in me, that there shall none come into this land\\nsave they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:7\\n 7 Wherefore, this land is consecrated unto him whom he shall\\nbring.  And if it so be that they shall serve him according to\\nthe commandments which he hath given, it shall be a land of\\nliberty unto them; wherefore, they shall never be brought down\\ninto captivity; if so, it shall be because of iniquity; for if\\niniquity shall abound cursed shall be the land for their sakes,\\nbut unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:8\\n 8 And behold, it is wisdom that this land should be kept as yet\\nfrom the knowledge of other nations; for behold, many nations\\nwould overrun the land, that there would be no place for an\\ninheritance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:9\\n 9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as\\nthose whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem\\nshall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of\\nthis land; and they shall be kept from all other nations, that\\nthey may possess this land unto themselves.  And if it so be that\\nthey shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the\\nface of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to\\ntake away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell\\nsafely forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:10\\n 10 But behold, when the time cometh that they shall dwindle in\\nunbelief, after they have received so great blessings from the\\nhand of the Lord--having a knowledge of the creation of the\\nearth, and all men, knowing the great and marvelous works of the\\nLord from the creation of the world; having power given them to\\ndo all things by faith; having all the commandments from the\\nbeginning, and having been brought by his infinite goodness into\\nthis precious land of promise--behold, I say, if the day shall\\ncome that they will reject the Holy One of Israel, the true\\nMessiah, their Redeemer and their God, behold, the judgments of\\nhim that is just shall rest upon them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:11\\n 11 Yea, he will bring other nations unto them, and he will give\\nunto them power, and he will take away from them the lands of\\ntheir possessions, and he will cause them to be scattered and\\nsmitten.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:12\\n 12 Yea, as one generation passeth to another there shall be\\nbloodsheds, and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons,\\nI would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would\\nhearken unto my words.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:13\\n 13 O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even\\nfrom the sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by which\\nye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of\\nmen, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal gulf\\nof misery and woe.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:14\\n 14 Awake!  and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a\\ntrembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold\\nand silent grave, from whence no traveler can return; a few more\\ndays and I go the way of all the earth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:15\\n 15 But behold, the Lord hath redeemed my soul from hell; I have\\nbeheld his glory, and I am encircled about eternally in the arms\\nof his love.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:16\\n 16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the statutes\\nand the judgments of the Lord; behold, this hath been the anxiety\\nof my soul from the beginning.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:17\\n 17 My heart hath been weighed down with sorrow from time to\\ntime, for I have feared, lest for the hardness of your hearts the\\nLord your God should come out in the fulness of his wrath upon\\nyou, that ye be cut off and destroyed forever;\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:18\\n 18 Or, that a cursing should come upon you for the space of many\\ngenerations; and ye are visited by sword, and by famine, and are\\nhated, and are led according to the will and captivity of the\\ndevil.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:19\\n 19 O my sons, that these things might not come upon you, but\\nthat ye might be a choice and a favored people of the Lord.  But\\nbehold, his will be done; for his ways are righteousness forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:20\\n 20 And he hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my\\ncommandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye\\nwill not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my\\npresence.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:21\\n 21 And now that my soul might have joy in you, and that my heart\\nmight leave this world with gladness because of you, that I might\\nnot be brought down with grief and sorrow to the grave, arise\\nfrom the dust, my sons, and be men, and be determined in one mind\\nand in one heart, united in all things, that ye may not come down\\ninto captivity;\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:22\\n 22 That ye may not be cursed with a sore cursing; and also, that\\nye may not incur the displeasure of a just God upon you, unto the\\ndestruction, yea, the eternal destruction of both soul and body.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:23\\n 23 Awake, my sons; put on the armor of righteousness.  Shake off\\nthe chains with which ye are bound, and come forth out of\\nobscurity, and arise from the dust.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:24\\n 24 Rebel no more against your brother, whose views have been\\nglorious, and who hath kept the commandments from the time that\\nwe left Jerusalem; and who hath been an instrument in the hands\\nof God, in bringing us forth into the land of promise; for were\\nit not for him, we must have perished with hunger in the\\nwilderness; nevertheless, ye sought to take away his life; yea,\\nand he hath suffered much sorrow because of you.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:25\\n 25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he\\nshall suffer again; for behold, ye have accused him that he\\nsought power and authority over you; but I know that he hath not\\nsought for power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the\\nglory of God, and your own eternal welfare.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:26\\n 26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you.  Ye\\nsay that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry\\nwith you; but behold, his sharpness was the sharpness of the\\npower of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye\\ncall anger was the truth, according to that which is in God,\\nwhich he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your\\niniquities.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:27\\n 27 And it must needs be that the power of God must be with him,\\neven unto his commanding you that ye must obey.  But behold, it\\nwas not he, but it was the Spirit of the Lord which was in him,\\nwhich opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:28\\n 28 And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my\\nsons who are the sons of Ishmael, behold, if ye will hearken unto\\nthe voice of Nephi ye shall not perish.  And if ye will hearken\\nunto him I leave unto you a blessing, yea, even my first\\nblessing.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:29\\n 29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my first\\nblessing, yea, even my blessing, and it shall rest upon him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:30\\n 30 And now Zoram, I speak unto you: Behold, thou art the servant\\nof Laban; nevertheless, thou hast been brought out of the land of\\nJerusalem, and I know that thou art a true friend unto my son,\\nNephi, forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:31\\n 31 Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be\\nblessed with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon\\nthe face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity\\namong them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face\\nof this land forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 1:32\\n 32 Wherefore, if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord, the\\nLord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with\\nthe seed of my son.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:1\\n 1 And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my first-born in\\nthe days of my tribulation in the wilderness.  And behold, in thy\\nchildhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because\\nof the rudeness of thy brethren.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:2\\n 2 Nevertheless, Jacob, my first-born in the wilderness, thou\\nknowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine\\nafflictions for thy gain.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:3\\n 3 Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell\\nsafely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in\\nthe service of thy God.  Wherefore, I know that thou art\\nredeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou\\nhast beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to bring\\nsalvation unto men.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:4\\n 4 And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou\\nart blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the\\nflesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever.\\n\\nAnd the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is\\nfree.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:5\\n 5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from\\nevil.  And the law is given unto men.  And by the law no flesh is\\njustified; or, by the law men are cut off.  Yea, by the temporal\\nlaw they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish\\nfrom that which is good, and become miserable forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:6\\n 6 Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah;\\nfor he is full of grace and truth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:7\\n 7 Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the\\nends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a\\ncontrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be\\nanswered.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:8\\n 8 Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known\\nunto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there\\nis no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be\\nthrough the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who\\nlayeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again\\nby the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the\\nresurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:9\\n 9 Wherefore, he is the first-fruits unto God, inasmuch as he\\nshall make intercession for all the children of men; and they\\nthat believe in him shall be saved.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:10\\n 10 And because of the intercession for all, all men come unto\\nGod; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him to be judged of\\nhim according to the truth and holiness which is in him. \\nWherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given,\\nunto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which\\npunishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the\\nhappiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement--\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:11\\n 11 For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all\\nthings.  If not so, my first-born in the wilderness,\\nrighteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness,\\nneither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad.  Wherefore,\\nall things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it\\nshould be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life\\nneither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor\\nmisery, neither sense nor insensibility.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:12\\n 12 Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of\\nnaught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of\\nits creation.  Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the\\nwisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and\\nthe mercy, and the justice of God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:13\\n 13 And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there\\nis no sin.  If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say\\nthere is no righteousness.  And if there be no righteousness\\nthere be no happiness.  And if there be no righteousness nor\\nhappiness there be no punishment nor misery.  And if these things\\nare not there is no God.  And if there is no God we are not,\\nneither the earth; for there could have been no creation of\\nthings, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all\\nthings must have vanished away.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:14\\n 14 And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your\\nprofit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all\\nthings, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in\\nthem are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:15\\n 15 And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man,\\nafter he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the\\nfield and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are\\ncreated, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the\\nforbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being\\nsweet and the other bitter.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:16\\n 16 Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for\\nhimself.  Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should\\nbe that he was enticed by the one or the other.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:17\\n 17 And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must\\nneeds suppose that an angel of God, according to that which is\\nwritten, had fallen from heaven; wherefore, he became a devil,\\nhaving sought that which was evil before God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:18\\n 18 And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become\\nmiserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. \\nWherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is\\nthe devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said:\\nPartake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye\\nshall be as God, knowing good and evil.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:19\\n 19 And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit\\nthey were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:20\\n 20 And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of\\nall the earth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:21\\n 21 And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according\\nto the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh;\\nwherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their\\ntime was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord\\nGod gave unto the children of men.  For he gave commandment that\\nall men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were\\nlost, because of the transgression of their parents.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:22\\n 22 And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not\\nhave fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. \\nAnd all things which were created must have remained in the same\\nstate in which they were after they were created; and they must\\nhave remained forever, and had no end.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:23\\n 23 And they would have had no children; wherefore they would\\nhave remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they\\nknew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:24\\n 24 But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him\\nwho knoweth all things.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:25\\n 25 Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might\\nhave joy.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:26\\n 26 And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may\\nredeem the children of men from the fall.  And because that they\\nare redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing\\ngood from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon,\\nsave it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last\\nday, according to the commandments which God hath given.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:27\\n 27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all\\nthings are given them which are expedient unto man.  And they are\\nfree to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great\\nMediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according\\nto the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all\\nmen might be miserable like unto himself.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:28\\n 28 And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great\\nMediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be\\nfaithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to\\nthe will of his Holy Spirit;\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:29\\n 29 And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the\\nflesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of\\nthe devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he\\nmay reign over you in his own kingdom.\\n\\n2 Nephi 2:30\\n 30 I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the\\nlast days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part,\\naccording to the words of the prophet.  And I have none other\\nobject save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls.  Amen.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:1\\n 1 And now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born.  Thou wast\\nborn in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of\\nmy greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:2\\n 2 And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, which is\\na most precious land, for thine inheritance and the inheritance\\nof thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so\\nbe that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:3\\n 3 And now, Joseph, my last-born, whom I have brought out of the\\nwilderness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever,\\nfor thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:4\\n 4 For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a\\ndescendant of Joseph who was carried captive into Egypt.  And\\ngreat were the covenants of the Lord which he made unto Joseph.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:5\\n 5 Wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day.  And he obtained a\\npromise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his loins the Lord\\nGod would raise up a righteous branch unto the house of Israel;\\nnot the Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off,\\nnevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants of the Lord that\\nthe Messiah should be made manifest unto them in the latter days,\\nin the spirit of power, unto the bringing of them out of darkness\\nunto light--yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto\\nfreedom.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:6\\n 6 For Joseph truly testified, saying: A seer shall the Lord my\\nGod raise up, who shall be a choice seer unto the fruit of my\\nloins.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:7\\n 7 Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice\\nseer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall\\nbe esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins.  And unto him\\nwill I give commandment that he shall do a work for the fruit of\\nthy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them,\\neven to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants\\nwhich I have made with thy fathers.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:8\\n 8 And I will give unto him a commandment that he shall do none\\nother work, save the work which I shall command him.  And I will\\nmake him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:9\\n 9 And he shall be great like unto Moses, whom I have said I\\nwould raise up unto you, to deliver my people, O house of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:10\\n 10 And Moses will I raise up, to deliver thy people out of the\\nland of Egypt.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:11\\n 11 But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and\\nunto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed\\nof thy loins--and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith\\nthe Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have\\nalready gone forth among them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:12\\n 12 Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit\\nof the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be\\nwritten by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be\\nwritten by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together,\\nunto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of\\ncontentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins,\\nand bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter\\ndays, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:13\\n 13 And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when\\nmy work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring\\nthee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:14\\n 14 And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will\\nthe Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him shall be\\nconfounded; for this promise, which I have obtained of the Lord,\\nof the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled.  Behold, I am sure\\nof the fulfilling of this promise;\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:15\\n 15 And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after\\nthe name of his father.  And he shall be like unto me; for the\\nthing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power\\nof the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:16\\n 16 Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I am sure of this thing, even as\\nI am sure of the promise of Moses; for the Lord hath said unto\\nme, I will preserve thy seed forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:17\\n 17 And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will\\ngive power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him\\nin writing.  Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak\\nmuch, for I will not make him mighty in speaking.  But I will\\nwrite unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will\\nmake a spokesman for him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:18\\n 18 And the Lord said unto me also: I will raise up unto the\\nfruit of thy loins; and I will make for him a spokesman.  And I,\\nbehold, I will give unto him that he shall write the writing of\\nthe fruit of thy loins, unto the fruit of thy loins; and the\\nspokesman of thy loins shall declare it.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:19\\n 19 And the words which he shall write shall be the words which\\nare expedient in my wisdom should go forth unto the fruit of thy\\nloins.  And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried\\nunto them from the dust; for I know their faith.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:20\\n 20 And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto\\ntheir brethren, even after many generations have gone by them. \\nAnd it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according\\nto the simpleness of their words.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:21\\n 21 Because of their faith their words shall proceed forth out of\\nmy mouth unto their brethren who are the fruit of thy loins; and\\nthe weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith,\\nunto the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy\\nfathers.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:22\\n 22 And now, behold, my son Joseph, after this manner did my\\nfather of old prophesy.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:23\\n 23 Wherefore, because of this covenant thou art blessed; for thy\\nseed shall not be destroyed, for they shall hearken unto the\\nwords of the book.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:24\\n 24 And there shall rise up one mighty among them, who shall do\\nmuch good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the\\nhands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and\\ndo that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the\\nbringing to pass much restoration unto the house of Israel, and\\nunto the seed of thy brethren.\\n\\n2 Nephi 3:25\\n 25 And now, blessed art thou, Joseph.  Behold, thou art little;\\nwherefore hearken unto the words of thy brother, Nephi, and it\\nshall be done unto thee even according to the words which I have\\nspoken.  Remember the words of thy dying father.  Amen.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:1\\n 1 And now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my\\nfather hath spoken, concerning Joseph, who was carried into\\nEgypt.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:2\\n 2 For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed.  And\\nthe prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater.  And\\nhe prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they\\nare written upon the plates of brass.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:3\\n 3 Wherefore, after my father had made an end of speaking\\nconcerning the prophecies of Joseph, he called the children of\\nLaman, his sons, and his daughters, and said unto them: Behold,\\nmy sons, and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of\\nmy first-born, I would that ye should give ear unto my words.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:4\\n 4 For the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my\\ncommandments ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye\\nwill not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my\\npresence.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:5\\n 5 But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot go down to my\\ngrave save I should leave a blessing upon you; for behold, I know\\nthat if ye are brought up in the way ye should go ye will not\\ndepart from it.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:6\\n 6 Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon\\nyou, that the cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon\\nthe heads of your parents.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:7\\n 7 Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God will not suffer\\nthat ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you and\\nunto your seed forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that after my father had made an end of\\nspeaking to the sons and daughters of Laman, he caused the sons\\nand daughters of Lemuel to be brought before him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:9\\n 9 And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my\\ndaughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my second son;\\nbehold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the\\nsons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be\\ndestroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of\\nspeaking unto them, behold, he spake unto the sons of Ishmael,\\nyea, and even all his household.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:11\\n 11 And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake\\nunto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed; for thou shall\\ninherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi.  And thy seed shall\\nbe numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy\\nbrother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be\\nblessed in all thy days.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:12\\n 12 And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had spoken unto\\nall his household, according to the feelings of his heart and the\\nSpirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old.  And it came\\nto pass that he died, and was buried.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that not many days after his death, Laman\\nand Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were angry with me because of\\nthe admonitions of the Lord.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:14\\n 14 For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according\\nto his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my\\nfather, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon\\nmine other plates; for a more history part are written upon mine\\nother plates.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:15\\n 15 And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the\\nscriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass.  For my\\nsoul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them,\\nand writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:16\\n 16 Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my\\nheart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and\\nheard.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:17\\n 17 Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord,\\nin showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth:\\nO wretched man that I am!  Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my\\nflesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:18\\n 18 I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the\\nsins which do so easily beset me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:19\\n 19 And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my\\nsins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:20\\n 20 My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine\\nafflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the\\nwaters of the great deep.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:21\\n 21 He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of\\nmy flesh.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:22\\n 22 He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to\\nquake before me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:23\\n 23 Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me\\nknowledge by visions in the nighttime.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:24\\n 24 And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer before him;\\nyea, my voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and\\nministered unto me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:25\\n 25 And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been carried\\naway upon exceedingly high mountains.  And mine eyes have beheld\\ngreat things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden\\nthat I should not write them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:26\\n 26 O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his\\ncondescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so\\nmuch mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the\\nvalley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength\\nslacken, because of mine afflictions?\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:27\\n 27 And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh?  Yea, why\\nshould I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in\\nmy heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul?  Why am I angry\\nbecause of mine enemy?\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:28\\n 28 Awake, my soul!  No longer droop in sin.  Rejoice, O my\\nheart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:29\\n 29 Do not anger again because of mine enemies.  Do not slacken\\nmy strength because of mine afflictions.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:30\\n 30 Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord,\\nI will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my\\nGod, and the rock of my salvation.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:31\\n 31 O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul?  Wilt thou deliver me out\\nof the hands of mine enemies?  Wilt thou make me that I may shake\\nat the appearance of sin?\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:32\\n 32 May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because\\nthat my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite!  O Lord, wilt\\nthou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I\\nmay walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in\\nthe plain road!\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:33\\n 33 O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy\\nrighteousness!  O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape\\nbefore mine enemies!  Wilt thou make my path straight before me! \\nWilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way--but that thou\\nwouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the\\nways of mine enemy.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:34\\n 34 O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee\\nforever.  I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know\\nthat cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. \\nYea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh\\nhis arm.\\n\\n2 Nephi 4:35\\n 35 Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. \\nYea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will\\nlift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God,\\nthe rock of my righteousness.  Behold, my voice shall forever\\nascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God.  Amen.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:1\\n 1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the\\nLord my God, because of the anger of my brethren.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:2\\n 2 But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that\\nthey did seek to take away my life.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:3\\n 3 Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother\\nthinks to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of\\nhim; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted\\nmore because of his words.  For behold, we will not have him to\\nbe our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren,\\nto rule over this people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:4\\n 4 Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they\\nmurmured against me.  But it sufficeth me to say, that they did\\nseek to take away my life.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi,\\nshould depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all\\nthose who would go with me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:6\\n 6 Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family,\\nand also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and\\nhis family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also\\nmy sisters, and all those who would go with me.  And all those\\nwho would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and\\nthe revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my\\nwords.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:7\\n 7 And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible\\nfor us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many\\ndays.  And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we\\ndid pitch our tents.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:8\\n 8 And my people would that we should call the name of the place\\nNephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:9\\n 9 And all those who were with me did take upon them to call\\nthemselves the people of Nephi.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:10\\n 10 And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes,\\nand the commandments of the Lord in all things according to the\\nlaw of Moses.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:11\\n 11 And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for\\nwe did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance.  And we\\nbegan to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:12\\n 12 And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were\\nengraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass,\\nwhich was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord,\\naccording to that which is written.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and\\nto multiply in the land.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:14\\n 14 And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and after the\\nmanner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people\\nwho were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us;\\nfor I knew their hatred towards me and my children and those who\\nwere called my people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:15\\n 15 And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in\\nall manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and\\nof steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which\\nwere in great abundance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:16\\n 16 And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it\\nafter the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built\\nof so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon\\nthe land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's\\ntemple.  But the manner of the construction was like unto the\\ntemple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly\\nfine.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be\\nindustrious, and to labor with their hands.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that they would that I should be their\\nking.  But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king;\\nnevertheless, I did for them according to that which was in my\\npower.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:19\\n 19 And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my\\nbrethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their\\nruler and their teacher.  Wherefore, I had been their ruler and\\ntheir teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until\\nthe time they sought to take away my life.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:20\\n 20 Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake\\nunto me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy\\nwords they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.  And\\nbehold, they were cut off from his presence.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:21\\n 21 And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a\\nsore cursing, because of their iniquity.  For behold, they had\\nhardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto\\na flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and\\ndelightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the\\nLord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:22\\n 22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be\\nloathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their\\niniquities.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:23\\n 23 And cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their\\nseed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing.  And\\nthe Lord spake it, and it was done.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:24\\n 24 And because of their cursing which was upon them they did\\nbecome an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did\\nseek in the wilderness for beasts of prey.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:25\\n 25 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a scourge unto\\nthy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as\\nthey will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall\\nscourge them even unto destruction.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did consecrate Jacob and\\nJoseph, that they should be priests and teachers over the land of\\nmy people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that we lived after the manner of\\nhappiness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:28\\n 28 And thirty years had passed away from the time we left\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:29\\n 29 And I, Nephi, had kept the records upon my plates, which I\\nhad made, of my people thus far.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that the Lord God said unto me: Make\\nother plates; and thou shalt engraven many things upon them which\\nare good in my sight, for the profit of thy people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:31\\n 31 Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of\\nthe Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven\\nthese things.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:32\\n 32 And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God.  And if my\\npeople are pleased with the things of God they will be pleased\\nwith mine engravings which are upon these plates.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:33\\n 33 And if my people desire to know the more particular part of\\nthe history of my people they must search mine other plates.\\n\\n2 Nephi 5:34\\n 34 And it sufficeth me to say that forty years had passed away,\\nand we had already had wars and contentions with our brethren.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:1\\n 1 The words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spake unto\\nthe people of Nephi:\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:2\\n 2 Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having been called of\\nGod, and ordained after the manner of his holy order, and having\\nbeen consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king\\nor a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know\\nthat I have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:3\\n 3 Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for\\nthe welfare of your souls.  Yea, mine anxiety is great for you;\\nand ye yourselves know that it ever has been.  For I have\\nexhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words\\nof my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things\\nwhich are written, from the creation of the world.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:4\\n 4 And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things\\nwhich are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the\\nwords of Isaiah.  And they are the words which my brother has\\ndesired that I should speak unto you.  And I speak unto you for\\nyour sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:5\\n 5 And now, the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah\\nspake concerning all the house of Israel; wherefore, they may be\\nlikened unto you, for ye are of the house of Israel.  And there\\nare many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be\\nlikened unto you, because ye are of the house of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:6\\n 6 And now these are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold,\\nI will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard\\nto the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and\\nthy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:7\\n 7 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy\\nnursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces\\ntowards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou\\nshalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that\\nwait for me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:8\\n 8 And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat concerning these words.\\n\\nFor behold, the Lord has shown me that those who were at\\nJerusalem, from whence we came, have been slain and carried away\\ncaptive.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:9\\n 9 Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should\\nreturn again.  And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God,\\nthe Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the\\nflesh; and after he should manifest himself they should scourge\\nhim and crucify him, according to the words of the angel who\\nspake it unto me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:10\\n 10 And after they have hardened their hearts and stiffened their\\nnecks against the Holy One of Israel, behold the judgments of the\\nHoly One of Israel shall come upon them.  And the day cometh that\\nthey shall be smitten and afflicted.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:11\\n 11 Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith\\nthe angel, many shall be afflicted in the flesh, and shall not be\\nsuffered to perish, because of the prayers of the faithful; they\\nshall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the\\nLord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the\\nknowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be gathered together\\nagain to the lands of their inheritance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:12\\n 12 And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has\\nwritten; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight\\nnot against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and\\nabominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will\\nfulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for\\nthis cause the prophet has written these things.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:13\\n 13 Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant\\npeople of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the\\npeople of the Lord shall not be ashamed.  For the people of the\\nLord are they who wait for him; for they still wait for the\\ncoming of the Messiah.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:14\\n 14 And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the\\nMessiah will set himself again the second time to recover them;\\nwherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great\\nglory, unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day\\ncometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy\\nthat believe in him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:15\\n 15 And they that believe not in him shall be destroyed, both by\\nfire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and\\nby pestilence, and by famine.  And they shall know that the Lord\\nis God, the Holy One of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:16\\n 16 For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful\\ncaptive delivered?\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:17\\n 17 But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty\\nshall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be\\ndelivered; for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. \\nFor thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth\\nwith thee--\\n\\n2 Nephi 6:18\\n 18 And I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh;\\nand they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet\\nwine; and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and\\nthy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:1\\n 1 Yea, for thus saith the Lord: Have I put thee away, or have I\\ncast thee off forever?  For thus saith the Lord: Where is the\\nbill of your mother's divorcement?  To whom have I put thee away,\\nor to which of my creditors have I sold you?  Yea, to whom have I\\nsold you?  Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves,\\nand for your transgressions is your mother put away.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:2\\n 2 Wherefore, when I came, there was no man; when I called, yea,\\nthere was none to answer.  O house of Israel, is my hand\\nshortened at all that it cannot redeem, or have I no power to\\ndeliver?  Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make their\\nrivers a wilderness and their fish to stink because the waters\\nare dried up, and they die because of thirst.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:3\\n 3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth\\ntheir covering.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:4\\n 4 The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I\\nshould know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O house of\\nIsrael.  When ye are weary he waketh morning by morning.  He\\nwaketh mine ear to hear as the learned.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:5\\n 5 The Lord God hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,\\nneither turned away back.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:6\\n 6 I gave my back to the smiter, and my cheeks to them that\\nplucked off the hair.  I hid not my face from shame and spitting.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:7\\n 7 For the Lord God will help me, therefore shall I not be\\nconfounded.  Therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I\\nknow that I shall not be ashamed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:8\\n 8 And the Lord is near, and he justifieth me.  Who will contend\\nwith me?  Let us stand together.  Who is mine adversary?  Let him\\ncome near me, and I will smite him with the strength of my mouth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:9\\n 9 For the Lord God will help me.  And all they who shall condemn\\nme, behold, all they shall wax old as a garment, and the moth\\nshall eat them up.\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:10\\n 10 Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the\\nvoice of his servant, that walketh in darkness and hath no light?\\n\\n2 Nephi 7:11\\n 11 Behold all ye that kindle fire, that compass yourselves about\\nwith sparks, walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks\\nwhich ye have kindled.  This shall ye have of mine hand--ye shall\\nlie down in sorrow.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:1\\n 1 Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness.  Look\\nunto the rock from whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit\\nfrom whence ye are digged.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:2\\n 2 Look unto Abraham, your father, and unto Sarah, she that bare\\nyou; for I called him alone, and blessed him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:3\\n 3 For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort all her waste\\nplaces; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert\\nlike the garden of the Lord.  Joy and gladness shall be found\\ntherein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:4\\n 4 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation;\\nfor a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to\\nrest for a light for the people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:5\\n 5 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine\\narm shall judge the people.  The isles shall wait upon me, and on\\nmine arm shall they trust.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:6\\n 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth\\nbeneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the\\nearth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein\\nshall die in like manner.  But my salvation shall be forever, and\\nmy righteousness shall not be abolished.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:7\\n 7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in\\nwhose heart I have written my law, fear ye not the reproach of\\nmen, neither be ye afraid of their revilings.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:8\\n 8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm\\nshall eat them like wool.  But my righteousness shall be forever,\\nand my salvation from generation to generation.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:9\\n 9 Awake, awake!  Put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake as in\\nthe ancient days.  Art thou not he that hath cut Rahab, and\\nwounded the dragon?\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:10\\n 10 Art thou not he who hath dried the sea, the waters of the\\ngreat deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the\\nransomed to pass over?\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:11\\n 11 Therefore, the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and come\\nwith singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy and holiness shall be\\nupon their heads; and they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow\\nand mourning shall flee away.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:12\\n 12 I am he; yea, I am he that comforteth you.  Behold, who art\\nthou, that thou shouldst be afraid of man, who shall die, and of\\nthe son of man, who shall be made like unto grass?\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:13\\n 13 And forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth\\nthe heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth, and hast\\nfeared continually every day, because of the fury of the\\noppressor, as if he were ready to destroy?  And where is the fury\\nof the oppressor?\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:14\\n 14 The captive exile hasteneth, that he may be loosed, and that\\nhe should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:15\\n 15 But I am the Lord thy God, whose waves roared; the Lord of\\nHosts is my name.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:16\\n 16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and have covered thee\\nin the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens and lay\\nthe foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion: Behold, thou art\\nmy people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:17\\n 17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the\\nhand of the Lord the cup of his fury--thou hast drunken the dregs\\nof the cup of trembling wrung out--\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:18\\n 18 And none to guide her among all the sons she hath brought\\nforth; neither that taketh her by the hand, of all the sons she\\nhath brought up.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:19\\n 19 These two sons are come unto thee, who shall be sorry for\\nthee--thy desolation and destruction, and the famine and the\\nsword--and by whom shall I comfort thee?\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:20\\n 20 Thy sons have fainted, save these two; they lie at the head\\nof all the streets; as a wild bull in a net, they are full of the\\nfury of the Lord, the rebuke of thy God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:21\\n 21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, and not\\nwith wine:\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:22\\n 22 Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause\\nof his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of\\ntrembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more\\ndrink it again.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:23\\n 23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;\\nwho have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over--and\\nthou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them\\nthat went over.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:24\\n 24 Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy\\nbeautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city; for henceforth\\nthere shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the\\nunclean.\\n\\n2 Nephi 8:25\\n 25 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem;\\nloose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of\\nZion.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:1\\n 1 And now, my beloved brethren, I have read these things that ye\\nmight know concerning the covenants of the Lord that he has\\ncovenanted with all the house of Israel--\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:2\\n 2 That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy\\nprophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to\\ngeneration, until the time comes that they shall be restored to\\nthe true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home\\nto the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in\\nall their lands of promise.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:3\\n 3 Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things\\nthat ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of\\nthe blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:4\\n 4 For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of\\nthings to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must\\nwaste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:5\\n 5 Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show\\nhimself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is\\nexpedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the\\ngreat Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto\\nman in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become\\nsubject unto him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:6\\n 6 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful\\nplan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of\\nresurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by\\nreason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression;\\nand because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence\\nof the Lord.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:7\\n 7 Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement--save it\\nshould be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on\\nincorruption.  Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man\\nmust needs have remained to an endless duration.  And if so, this\\nflesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother\\nearth, to rise no more.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:8\\n 8 O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace!  For behold, if the\\nflesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that\\nangel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and\\nbecame the devil, to rise no more.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:9\\n 9 And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become\\ndevils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of\\nour God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like\\nunto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents,\\nwho transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and\\nstirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of\\nmurder and all manner of secret works of darkness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:10\\n 10 O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for\\nour escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that\\nmonster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and\\nalso the death of the spirit.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:11\\n 11 And because of the way of deliverance of our God, the Holy\\nOne of Israel, this death, of which I have spoken, which is the\\ntemporal, shall deliver up its dead; which death is the grave.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:12\\n 12 And this death of which I have spoken, which is the spiritual\\ndeath, shall deliver up its dead; which spiritual death is hell;\\nwherefore, death and hell must deliver up their dead, and hell\\nmust deliver up its captive spirits, and the grave must deliver\\nup its captive bodies, and the bodies and the spirits of men will\\nbe restored one to the other; and it is by the power of the\\nresurrection of the Holy One of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:13\\n 13 O how great the plan of our God!  For on the other hand, the\\nparadise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and\\nthe grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit\\nand the body is restored to itself again, and all men become\\nincorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a\\nperfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our\\nknowledge shall be perfect.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:14\\n 14 Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our\\nguilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous\\nshall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their\\nrighteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe\\nof righteousness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:15\\n 15 And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed\\nfrom this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become\\nimmortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy\\nOne of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they\\nbe judged according to the holy judgment of God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:16\\n 16 And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath\\nspoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot pass away,\\nthat they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they\\nwho are filthy shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are\\nfilthy are the devil and his angels; and they shall go away into\\neverlasting fire; prepared for them; and their torment is as a\\nlake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and\\never and has no end.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:17\\n 17 O the greatness and the justice of our God!  For he executeth\\nall his words, and they have gone forth out of his mouth, and his\\nlaw must be fulfilled.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:18\\n 18 But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of\\nIsrael, they who have believed in the Holy One of Israel, they\\nwho have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame\\nof it, they shall inherit the kingdom of God, which was prepared\\nfor them from the foundation of the world, and their joy shall be\\nfull forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:19\\n 19 O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of\\nIsrael!  For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster the\\ndevil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone,\\nwhich is endless torment.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:20\\n 20 O how great the holiness of our God!  For he knoweth all\\nthings, and there is not anything save he knows it.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:21\\n 21 And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they\\nwill hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains\\nof all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men,\\nwomen, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:22\\n 22 And he suffereth this that the resurrection might pass upon\\nall men, that all might stand before him at the great and\\njudgment day.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:23\\n 23 And he commandeth all men that they must repent, and be\\nbaptized in his name, having perfect faith in the Holy One of\\nIsrael, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:24\\n 24 And if they will not repent and believe in his name, and be\\nbaptized in his name, and endure to the end, they must be damned;\\nfor the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has spoken it.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:25\\n 25 Wherefore, he has given a law; and where there is no law\\ngiven there is no punishment; and where there is no punishment\\nthere is no condemnation; and where there is no condemnation the\\nmercies of the Holy One of Israel have claim upon them, because\\nof the atonement; for they are delivered by the power of him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:26\\n 26 For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon\\nall those who have not the law given to them, that they are\\ndelivered from that awful monster, death and hell, and the devil,\\nand the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and\\nthey are restored to that God who gave them breath, which is the\\nHoly One of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:27\\n 27 But wo unto him that has the law given, yea, that has all the\\ncommandments of God, like unto us, and that transgresseth them,\\nand that wasteth the days of his probation, for awful is his\\nstate!\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:28\\n 28 O that cunning plan of the evil one!  O the vainness, and the\\nfrailties, and the foolishness of men!  When they are learned\\nthey think they are wise, and they hearken not unto the counsel\\nof God, for they set it aside, supposing they know of themselves,\\nwherefore, their wisdom is foolishness and it profiteth them not.\\n\\nAnd they shall perish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:29\\n 29 But to be learned is good if they hearken unto the counsels\\nof God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:30\\n 30 But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the\\nworld.  For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they\\npersecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures;\\nwherefore, their treasure is their God.  And behold, their\\ntreasure shall perish with them also.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:31\\n 31 And wo unto the deaf that will not hear; for they shall\\nperish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:32\\n 32 Wo unto the blind that will not see; for they shall perish\\nalso.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:33\\n 33 Wo unto the uncircumcised of heart, for a knowledge of their\\niniquities shall smite them at the last day.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:34\\n 34 Wo unto the liar, for he shall be thrust down to hell.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:35\\n 35 Wo unto the murderer who deliberately killeth, for he shall\\ndie.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:36\\n 36 Wo unto them who commit whoredoms, for they shall be thrust\\ndown to hell.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:37\\n 37 Yea, wo unto those that worship idols, for the devil of all\\ndevils delighteth in them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:38\\n 38 And, in fine, wo unto all those who die in their sins; for\\nthey shall return to God, and behold his face, and remain in\\ntheir sins.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:39\\n 39 O, my beloved brethren, remember the awfulness in\\ntransgressing against that Holy God, and also the awfulness of\\nyielding to the enticings of that cunning one.  Remember, to be\\ncarnally-minded is death, and to be spiritually-minded is life\\neternal.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:40\\n 40 O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words.  Remember the\\ngreatness of the Holy One of Israel.  Do not say that I have\\nspoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will revile\\nagainst the truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker.  I\\nknow that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness;\\nbut the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are\\nnot shaken.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:41\\n 41 O then, my beloved brethren, come unto the Lord, the Holy\\nOne.  Remember that his paths are righteous.  Behold, the way for\\nman is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and\\nthe keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he\\nemployeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it\\nbe by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is\\nhis name.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:42\\n 42 And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and\\nthe learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of\\ntheir learning, and their wisdom, and their riches--yea, they are\\nthey whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things\\naway, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in\\nthe depths of humility, he will not open unto them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:43\\n 43 But the things of the wise and the prudent shall be hid from\\nthem forever--yea, that happiness which is prepared for the\\nsaints.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:44\\n 44 O, my beloved brethren, remember my words.  Behold, I take\\noff my garments, and I shake them before you; I pray the God of\\nmy salvation that he view me with his all-searching eye;\\nwherefore, ye shall know at the last day, when all men shall be\\njudged of their works, that the God of Israel did witness that I\\nshook your iniquities from my soul, and that I stand with\\nbrightness before him, and am rid of your blood.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:45\\n 45 O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off\\nthe chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God\\nwho is the rock of your salvation.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:46\\n 46 Prepare your souls for that glorious day when justice shall\\nbe administered unto the righteous, even the day of judgment,\\nthat ye may not shrink with awful fear; that ye may not remember\\nyour awful guilt in perfectness, and be constrained to exclaim:\\nHoly, holy are thy judgments, O Lord God Almighty--but I know my\\nguilt; I transgressed thy law, and my transgressions are mine;\\nand the devil hath obtained me, that I am a prey to his awful\\nmisery.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:47\\n 47 But behold, my brethren, is it expedient that I should awake\\nyou to an awful reality of these things?  Would I harrow up your\\nsouls if your minds were pure?  Would I be plain unto you\\naccording to the plainness of the truth if ye were freed from\\nsin?\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:48\\n 48 Behold, if ye were holy I would speak unto you of holiness;\\nbut as ye are not holy, and ye look upon me as a teacher, it must\\nneeds be expedient that I teach you the consequences of sin.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:49\\n 49 Behold, my soul abhorreth sin, and my heart delighteth in\\nrighteousness; and I will praise the holy name of my God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:50\\n 50 Come, my brethren, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the\\nwaters; and he that hath no money, come buy and eat; yea, come\\nbuy wine and milk without money and without price.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:51\\n 51 Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth,\\nnor your labor for that which cannot satisfy.  Hearken diligently\\nunto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come\\nunto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth\\nnot, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in\\nfatness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:52\\n 52 Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God;\\npray unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy\\nname by night.  Let your hearts rejoice.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:53\\n 53 And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great\\nhis condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his\\ngreatness, and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that\\nour seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh,\\nbut that he would preserve them; and in future generations they\\nshall become a righteous branch unto the house of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 9:54\\n 54 And now, my brethren, I would speak unto you more; but on the\\nmorrow I will declare unto you the remainder of my words.  Amen.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:1\\n 1 And now I, Jacob, speak unto you again, my beloved brethren,\\nconcerning this righteous branch of which I have spoken.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:2\\n 2 For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises\\nunto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown\\nunto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh\\nbecause of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto\\nmany; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to\\nthat which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:3\\n 3 Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that\\nChrist--for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this\\nshould be his name--should come among the Jews, among those who\\nare the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify\\nhim--for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other\\nnation on earth that would crucify their God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:4\\n 4 For should the mighty miracles be wrought among other nations\\nthey would repent, and know that he be their God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:5\\n 5 But because of priestcrafts and iniquities, they at Jerusalem\\nwill stiffen their necks against him, that he be crucified.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:6\\n 6 Wherefore, because of their iniquities, destructions, famines,\\npestilences, and bloodshed shall come upon them; and they who\\nshall not be destroyed shall be scattered among all nations.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:7\\n 7 But behold, thus saith the Lord God: When the day cometh that\\nthey shall believe in me, that I am Christ, then have I\\ncovenanted with their fathers that they shall be restored in the\\nflesh, upon the earth, unto the lands of their inheritance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:8\\n 8 And it shall come to pass that they shall be gathered in from\\ntheir long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the\\nfour parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be\\ngreat in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the\\nlands of their inheritance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:9\\n 9 Yea, the kings of the Gentiles shall be nursing fathers unto\\nthem, and their queens shall become nursing mothers; wherefore,\\nthe promises of the Lord are great unto the Gentiles, for he hath\\nspoken it, and who can dispute?\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:10\\n 10 But behold, this land, said God, shall be a land of thine\\ninheritance, and the Gentiles shall be blessed upon the land.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:11\\n 11 And this land shall be a land of liberty unto the Gentiles,\\nand there shall be no kings upon the land, who shall raise up\\nunto the Gentiles.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:12\\n 12 And I will fortify this land against all other nations.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:13\\n 13 And he that fighteth against Zion shall perish, saith God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:14\\n 14 For he that raiseth up a king against me shall perish, for I,\\nthe Lord, the king of heaven, will be their king, and I will be a\\nlight unto them forever, that hear my words.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:15\\n 15 Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled\\nwhich I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto\\nthem while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret\\nworks of darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:16\\n 16 Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both Jew and\\nGentile, both bond and free, both male and female, shall perish;\\nfor they are they who are the whore of all the earth; for they\\nwho are not for me are against me, saith our God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:17\\n 17 For I will fulfil my promises which I have made unto the\\nchildren of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the\\nflesh--\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:18\\n 18 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: I will\\nafflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I\\nwill soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like\\nunto a father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be blessed\\nand numbered among the house of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:19\\n 19 Wherefore, I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and\\nthem who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land\\nof their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me,\\nabove all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell\\nthereon that they shall worship me, saith God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:20\\n 20 And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God\\nhas given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us\\nremember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our\\nheads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven\\nout of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to a\\nbetter land, for the Lord has made the sea our path, and we are\\nupon an isle of the sea.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:21\\n 21 But great are the promises of the Lord unto them who are upon\\nthe isles of the sea; wherefore as it says isles, there must\\nneeds be more than this, and they are inhabited also by our\\nbrethren.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:22\\n 22 For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from\\nthe house of Israel, according to his will and pleasure.  And now\\nbehold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off,\\nwherefore he remembereth us also.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:23\\n 23 Therefore, cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are\\nfree to act for yourselves--to choose the way of everlasting\\ndeath or the way of eternal life.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:24\\n 24 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, reconcile yourselves to the\\nwill of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and\\nremember, after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in\\nand through the grace of God that ye are saved.\\n\\n2 Nephi 10:25\\n 25 Wherefore, may God raise you from death by the power of the\\nresurrection, and also from everlasting death by the power of the\\natonement, that ye may be received into the eternal kingdom of\\nGod, that ye may praise him through grace divine.  Amen.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11\\nChapter 11\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:1\\n 1 And now, Jacob spake many more things to my people at that\\ntime; nevertheless only these things have I caused to be written,\\nfor the things which I have written sufficeth me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:2\\n 2 And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my\\nsoul delighteth in his words.  For I will liken his words unto my\\npeople, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he\\nverily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:3\\n 3 And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him;\\nwherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to\\nprove unto them that my words are true.  Wherefore, by the words\\nof three, God hath said, I will establish my word.  Nevertheless,\\nGod sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:4\\n 4 Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth\\nof the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses\\nbeen given; and all things which have been given of God from the\\nbeginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:5\\n 5 And also my soul delighteth in the covenants of the Lord which\\nhe hath made to our fathers; yea, my soul delighteth in his\\ngrace, and in his justice, and power, and mercy in the great and\\neternal plan of deliverance from death.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:6\\n 6 And my soul delighteth in proving unto my people that save\\nChrist should come all men must perish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:7\\n 7 For if there be no Christ there be no God; and if there be no\\nGod we are not, for there could have been no creation.  But there\\nis a God, and he is Christ, and he cometh in the fulness of his\\nown time.\\n\\n2 Nephi 11:8\\n 8 And now I write some of the words of Isaiah, that whoso of my\\npeople shall see these words may lift up their hearts and rejoice\\nfor all men.

Then I said: Here am I; send me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 16:9\\n 9 And he said: Go and tell this people--Hear ye indeed, but they\\nunderstood not; and see ye indeed, but they perceived not.\\n\\n2 Nephi 16:10\\n 10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,\\nand shut their eyes--lest they see with their eyes, and hear with\\ntheir ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and\\nbe healed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 16:11\\n 11 Then said I: Lord, how long?

For\\nbehold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my\\npeople to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of\\nprophesying among the Jews.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:2\\n 2 For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the\\nmanner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and\\ntheir doings were doings of abominations.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:3\\n 3 Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall\\nreceive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know\\nthe judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according\\nto the word which he hath spoken.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:4\\n 4 Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of\\nIsrael, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of\\nIsaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto\\nall those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy.  But I\\ngive unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me;\\nwherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath\\nbeen with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my\\nfather; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my\\npeople, that they may learn.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:5\\n 5 Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came\\nout from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the\\nJews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the\\nprophets, and there is none other people that understand the\\nthings which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be\\nthat they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:6\\n 6 But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the\\nmanner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at\\nJerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about;\\nand I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments\\nof God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children,\\naccording to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not\\nwrite them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:7\\n 7 But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my\\nplainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless,\\nin the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men\\nshall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to\\npass.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:8\\n 8 Wherefore, they are of worth unto the children of men, and he\\nthat supposeth that they are not, unto them will I speak\\nparticularly, and confine the words unto mine own people; for I\\nknow that they shall be of great worth unto them in the last\\ndays; for in that day shall they understand them; wherefore, for\\ntheir good have I written them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:9\\n 9 And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews\\nbecause of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from\\ngeneration to generation according to their iniquities; and never\\nhath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the\\nprophets of the Lord.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:10\\n 10 Wherefore, it hath been told them concerning the destruction\\nwhich should come upon them, immediately after my father left\\nJerusalem; nevertheless, they hardened their hearts; and\\naccording to my prophecy they have been destroyed, save it be\\nthose which are carried away captive into Babylon.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:11\\n 11 And now this I speak because of the spirit which is in me. \\nAnd notwithstanding they have been carried away they shall return\\nagain, and possess the land of Jerusalem; wherefore, they shall\\nbe restored again to the land of their inheritance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:12\\n 12 But, behold, they shall have wars, and rumors of wars; and\\nwhen the day cometh that the Only Begotten of the Father, yea,\\neven the Father of heaven and of earth, shall manifest himself\\nunto them in the flesh, behold, they will reject him, because of\\ntheir iniquities, and the hardness of their hearts, and the\\nstiffness of their necks.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:13\\n 13 Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a\\nsepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the\\ndead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe\\non his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God.  Wherefore, my\\nsoul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his\\nday, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:14\\n 14 And behold it shall come to pass that after the Messiah hath\\nrisen from the dead, and hath manifested himself unto his people,\\nunto as many as will believe on his name, behold, Jerusalem shall\\nbe destroyed again; for wo unto them that fight against God and\\nthe people of his church.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:15\\n 15 Wherefore, the Jews shall be scattered among all nations;\\nyea, and also Babylon shall be destroyed; wherefore, the Jews\\nshall be scattered by other nations.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:16\\n 16 And after they have been scattered, and the Lord God hath\\nscourged them by other nations for the space of many generations,\\nyea, even down from generation to generation until they shall be\\npersuaded to believe in Christ, the Son of God, and the\\natonement, which is infinite for all mankind--and when that day\\nshall come that they shall believe in Christ, and worship the\\nFather in his name, with pure hearts and clean hands, and look\\nnot forward any more for another Messiah, then, at that time, the\\nday will come that it must needs be expedient that they should\\nbelieve these things.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:17\\n 17 And the Lord will set his hand again the second time to\\nrestore his people from their lost and fallen state.  Wherefore,\\nhe will proceed to do a marvelous work and a wonder among the\\nchildren of men.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:18\\n 18 Wherefore, he shall bring forth his words unto them, which\\nwords shall judge them at the last day, for they shall be given\\nthem for the purpose of convincing them of the true Messiah, who\\nwas rejected by them; and unto the convincing of them that they\\nneed not look forward any more for a Messiah to come, for there\\nshould not any come, save it should be a false Messiah which\\nshould deceive the people; for there is save one Messiah spoken\\nof by the prophets, and that Messiah is he who should be rejected\\nof the Jews.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:19\\n 19 For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah\\ncometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left\\nJerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also\\nthe word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the\\nSon of God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:20\\n 20 And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot\\nerr.  And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of\\nthe land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal\\nthe nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents,\\nif they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise\\nup before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the\\nrock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you,\\nthat as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there\\nis none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus\\nChrist, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:21\\n 21 Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me\\nthat these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and\\nhanded down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the\\npromise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never\\nperish as long as the earth should stand.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:22\\n 22 Wherefore, these things shall go from generation to\\ngeneration as long as the earth shall stand; and they shall go\\naccording to the will and pleasure of God; and the nations who\\nshall possess them shall be judged of them according to the words\\nwhich are written.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:23\\n 23 For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children,\\nand also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled\\nto God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after\\nall we can do.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:24\\n 24 And, notwithstanding we believe in Christ, we keep the law of\\nMoses, and look forward with steadfastness unto Christ, until the\\nlaw shall be fulfilled.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:25\\n 25 For, for this end was the law given; wherefore the law hath\\nbecome dead unto us, and we are made alive in Christ because of\\nour faith; yet we keep the law because of the commandments.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:26\\n 26 And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of\\nChrist, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our\\nprophecies, that our children may know to what source they may\\nlook for a remission of their sins.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:27\\n 27 Wherefore, we speak concerning the law that our children may\\nknow the deadness of the law; and they, by knowing the deadness\\nof the law, may look forward unto that life which is in Christ,\\nand know for what end the law was given.  And after the law is\\nfulfilled in Christ, that they need not harden their hearts\\nagainst him when the law ought to be done away.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:28\\n 28 And now behold, my people, ye are a stiffnecked people;\\nwherefore, I have spoken plainly unto you, that ye cannot\\nmisunderstand.  And the words which I have spoken shall stand as\\na testimony against you; for they are sufficient to teach any man\\nthe right way; for the right way is to believe in Christ and deny\\nhim not; for by denying him ye also deny the prophets and the\\nlaw.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:29\\n 29 And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to\\nbelieve in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One\\nof Israel; wherefore ye must bow down before him, and worship him\\nwith all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and\\nif ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out.\\n\\n2 Nephi 25:30\\n 30 And, inasmuch as it shall be expedient, ye must keep the\\nperformances and ordinances of God until the law shall be\\nfulfilled which was given unto Moses.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26\\nChapter 26\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:1\\n 1 And after Christ shall have risen from the dead he shall show\\nhimself unto you, my children, and my beloved brethren; and the\\nwords which he shall speak unto you shall be the law which ye\\nshall do.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:2\\n 2 For behold, I say unto you that I have beheld that many\\ngenerations shall pass away, and there shall be great wars and\\ncontentions among my people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:3\\n 3 And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given\\nunto my people of his birth, and also of his death and\\nresurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the\\nwicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast\\nout the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them;\\nwherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to\\nGod from the ground against them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:4\\n 4 Wherefore, all those who are proud, and that do wickedly, the\\nday that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, for\\nthey shall be as stubble.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:5\\n 5 And they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of\\nthe earth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and\\nmountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away,\\nand buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and\\ngrind them to powder.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:6\\n 6 And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings,\\nand earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of\\nthe anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they\\nshall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them,\\nsaith the Lord of Hosts.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:7\\n 7 O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the\\nslain of my people!  For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh\\nconsumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto\\nmy God: Thy ways are just.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:8\\n 8 But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the\\nprophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with\\nsteadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all\\npersecution--behold, they are they which shall not perish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:9\\n 9 But the Son of righteousness shall appear unto them; and he\\nshall heal them, and they shall have peace with him, until three\\ngenerations shall have passed away, and many of the fourth\\ngeneration shall have passed away in righteousness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:10\\n 10 And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction\\ncometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul,\\nI have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and\\nthey sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their\\npride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for\\nbecause they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness\\nrather than light, therefore they must go down to hell.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:11\\n 11 For the Spirit of the Lord will not always strive with man. \\nAnd when the Spirit ceaseth to strive with man then cometh speedy\\ndestruction, and this grieveth my soul.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:12\\n 12 And as I spake concerning the convincing of the Jews, that\\nJesus is the very Christ, it must needs be that the Gentiles be\\nconvinced also that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God;\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:13\\n 13 And that he manifesteth himself unto all those who believe in\\nhim, by the power of the Holy Ghost; yea, unto every nation,\\nkindred, tongue, and people, working mighty miracles, signs, and\\nwonders, among the children of men according to their faith.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:14\\n 14 But behold, I prophesy unto you concerning the last days;\\nconcerning the days when the Lord God shall bring these things\\nforth unto the children of men.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:15\\n 15 After my seed and the seed of my brethren shall have dwindled\\nin unbelief, and shall have been smitten by the Gentiles; yea,\\nafter the Lord God shall have camped against them round about,\\nand shall have laid siege against them with a mount, and raised\\nforts against them; and after they shall have been brought down\\nlow in the dust, even that they are not, yet the words of the\\nrighteous shall be written, and the prayers of the faithful shall\\nbe heard, and all those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not\\nbe forgotten.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:16\\n 16 For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of\\nthe ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and\\ntheir voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the\\nLord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning\\nthem, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall\\nwhisper out of the dust.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:17\\n 17 For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things\\nwhich shall be done among them, and they shall be written and\\nsealed up in a book, and those who have dwindled in unbelief\\nshall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:18\\n 18 Wherefore, as those who have been destroyed have been\\ndestroyed speedily; and the multitude of their terrible ones\\nshall be as chaff that passeth away--yea, thus saith the Lord\\nGod: It shall be at an instant, suddenly--\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:19\\n 19 And it shall come to pass, that those who have dwindled in\\nunbelief shall be smitten by the hand of the Gentiles.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:20\\n 20 And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes,\\nand have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling\\nblock, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they\\nput down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto\\nthemselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may\\nget gain and grind upon the face of the poor.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:21\\n 21 And there are many churches built up which cause envyings,\\nand strifes, and malice.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:22\\n 22 And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of\\nold, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the\\nfounder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and\\nworks of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a\\nflaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:23\\n 23 For behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you that the Lord\\nGod worketh not in darkness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:24\\n 24 He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the\\nworld; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own\\nlife that he may draw all men unto him.  Wherefore, he commandeth\\nnone that they shall not partake of his salvation.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:25\\n 25 Behold, doth he cry unto any, saying: Depart from me? \\nBehold, I say unto you, Nay; but he saith: Come unto me all ye\\nends of the earth, buy milk and honey, without money and without\\nprice.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:26\\n 26 Behold, hath he commanded any that they should depart out of\\nthe synagogues, or out of the houses of worship?  Behold, I say\\nunto you, Nay.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:27\\n 27 Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his\\nsalvation?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free\\nfor all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should\\npersuade all men to repentance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:28\\n 28 Behold, hath the Lord commanded any that they should not\\npartake of his goodness?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; but all men\\nare privileged the one like unto the other, and none are\\nforbidden.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:29\\n 29 He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for,\\nbehold priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for\\na light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the\\nworld; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:30\\n 30 Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the\\nLord God hath given a commandment that all men should have\\ncharity, which charity is love, and except they should have\\ncharity they were nothing.  Wherefore, if they should have\\ncharity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:31\\n 31 But the laborer in Zion shall labor for Zion; for if they\\nlabor for money they shall perish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:32\\n 32 And again, the Lord God hath commanded that men should not\\nmurder; that they should not lie; that they should not steal;\\nthat they should not take the name of the Lord their God in vain;\\nthat they should not envy; that they should not have malice; that\\nthey should not contend one with another; that they should not\\ncommit whoredoms; and that they should do none of these things;\\nfor whoso doeth them shall perish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 26:33\\n 33 For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth\\nthat which is good among the children of men; and he doeth\\nnothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he\\ninviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness;\\nand he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and\\nfree, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all\\nare alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27\\nChapter 27\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:1\\n 1 But, behold, in the last days, or in the days of the\\nGentiles--yea, behold all the nations of the Gentiles and also\\nthe Jews, both those who shall come upon this land and those who\\nshall be upon other lands, yea, even upon all the lands of the\\nearth, behold, they will be drunken with iniquity and all manner\\nof abominations--\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:2\\n 2 And when that day shall come they shall be visited of the Lord\\nof Hosts, with thunder and with earthquake, and with a great\\nnoise, and with storm, and with tempest, and with the flame of\\ndevouring fire.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:3\\n 3 And all the nations that fight against Zion, and that distress\\nher, shall be as a dream of a night vision; yea, it shall be unto\\nthem, even as unto a hungry man which dreameth, and behold he\\neateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty; or like unto a\\nthirsty man which dreameth, and behold he drinketh but he awaketh\\nand behold he is faint, and his soul hath appetite; yea, even so\\nshall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against\\nMount Zion.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:4\\n 4 For behold, all ye that doeth iniquity, stay yourselves and\\nwonder, for ye shall cry out, and cry; yea, ye shall be drunken\\nbut not with wine, ye shall stagger but not with strong drink.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:5\\n 5 For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of\\ndeep sleep.  For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have\\nrejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he\\ncovered because of your iniquity.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:6\\n 6 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall bring forth\\nunto you the words of a book, and they shall be the words of them\\nwhich have slumbered.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:7\\n 7 And behold the book shall be sealed; and in the book shall be\\na revelation from God, from the beginning of the world to the\\nending thereof.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:8\\n 8 Wherefore, because of the things which are sealed up, the\\nthings which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the\\nwickedness and abominations of the people.  Wherefore the book\\nshall be kept from them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:9\\n 9 But the book shall be delivered unto a man, and he shall\\ndeliver the words of the book, which are the words of those who\\nhave slumbered in the dust, and he shall deliver these words unto\\nanother;\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:10\\n 10 But the words which are sealed he shall not deliver, neither\\nshall he deliver the book.  For the book shall be sealed by the\\npower of God, and the revelation which was sealed shall be kept\\nin the book until the own due time of the Lord, that they may\\ncome forth; for behold, they reveal all things from the\\nfoundation of the world unto the end thereof.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:11\\n 11 And the day cometh that the words of the book which were\\nsealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read\\nby the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the\\nchildren of men which ever have been among the children of men,\\nand which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:12\\n 12 Wherefore, at that day when the book shall be delivered unto\\nthe man of whom I have spoken, the book shall be hid from the\\neyes of the world, that the eyes of none shall behold it save it\\nbe that three witnesses shall behold it, by the power of God,\\nbesides him to whom the book shall be delivered; and they shall\\ntestify to the truth of the book and the things therein.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:13\\n 13 And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few\\naccording to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto\\nthe children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of\\nthe faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:14\\n 14 Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to bring forth the words\\nof the book; and in the mouth of as many witnesses as seemeth him\\ngood will he establish his word; and wo be unto him that\\nrejecteth the word of God!\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:15\\n 15 But behold, it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall say\\nunto him to whom he shall deliver the book: Take these words\\nwhich are not sealed and deliver them to another, that he may\\nshow them unto the learned, saying: Read this, I pray thee.  And\\nthe learned shall say: Bring hither the book, and I will read\\nthem.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:16\\n 16 And now, because of the glory of the world and to get gain\\nwill they say this, and not for the glory of God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:17\\n 17 And the man shall say: I cannot bring the book, for it is\\nsealed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:18\\n 18 Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:19\\n 19 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that the Lord God will\\ndeliver again the book and the words thereof to him that is not\\nlearned; and the man that is not learned shall say: I am not\\nlearned.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:20\\n 20 Then shall the Lord God say unto him: The learned shall not\\nread them, for they have rejected them, and I am able to do mine\\nown work; wherefore thou shalt read the words which I shall give\\nunto thee.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:21\\n 21 Touch not the things which are sealed, for I will bring them\\nforth in mine own due time; for I will show unto the children of\\nmen that I am able to do mine own work.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:22\\n 22 Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have\\ncommanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised\\nunto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up\\nunto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read,\\nuntil I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things\\nunto the children of men.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:23\\n 23 For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will\\nshow unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and\\nforever; and I work not among the children of men save it be\\naccording to their faith.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:24\\n 24 And again it shall come to pass that the Lord shall say unto\\nhim that shall read the words that shall be delivered him:\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:25\\n 25 Forasmuch as this people draw near unto me with their mouth,\\nand with their lips do honor me, but have removed their hearts\\nfar from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precepts\\nof men--\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:26\\n 26 Therefore, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this\\npeople, yea, a marvelous work and a wonder, for the wisdom of\\ntheir wise and learned shall perish, and the understanding of\\ntheir prudent shall be hid.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:27\\n 27 And wo unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from\\nthe Lord!  And their works are in the dark; and they say: Who\\nseeth us, and who knoweth us?  And they also say: Surely, your\\nturning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's\\nclay.  But behold, I will show unto them, saith the Lord of\\nHosts, that I know all their works.  For shall the work say of\\nhim that made it, he made me not?  Or shall the thing framed say\\nof him that framed it, he had no understanding?\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:28\\n 28 But behold, saith the Lord of Hosts: I will show unto the\\nchildren of men that it is yet a very little while and Lebanon\\nshall be turned into a fruitful field; and the fruitful field\\nshall be esteemed as a forest.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:29\\n 29 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book,\\nand the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of\\ndarkness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:30\\n 30 And the meek also shall increase, and their joy shall be in\\nthe Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of\\nIsrael.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:31\\n 31 For assuredly as the Lord liveth they shall see that the\\nterrible one is brought to naught, and the scorner is consumed,\\nand all that watch for iniquity are cut off;\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:32\\n 32 And they that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a\\nsnare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just\\nfor a thing of naught.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:33\\n 33 Therefore, thus saith the Lord, who redeemed Abraham,\\nconcerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed,\\nneither shall his face now wax pale.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:34\\n 34 But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the\\nmidst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy\\nOne of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 27:35\\n 35 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,\\nand they that murmured shall learn doctrine.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28\\nChapter 28\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:1\\n 1 And now, behold, my brethren, I have spoken unto you,\\naccording as the Spirit hath constrained me; wherefore, I know\\nthat they must surely come to pass.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:2\\n 2 And the things which shall be written out of the book shall be\\nof great worth unto the children of men, and especially unto our\\nseed, which is a remnant of the house of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:3\\n 3 For it shall come to pass in that day that the churches which\\nare built up, and not unto the Lord, when the one shall say unto\\nthe other: Behold, I, I am the Lord's; and the others shall say:\\nI, I am the Lord's; and thus shall every one say that hath built\\nup churches, and not unto the Lord--\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:4\\n 4 And they shall contend one with another; and their priests\\nshall contend one with another, and they shall teach with their\\nlearning, and deny the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:5\\n 5 And they deny the power of God, the Holy One of Israel; and\\nthey say unto the people: Hearken unto us, and hear ye our\\nprecept; for behold there is no God today, for the Lord and the\\nRedeemer hath done his work, and he hath given his power unto\\nmen;\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:6\\n 6 Behold, hearken ye unto my precept; if they shall say there is\\na miracle wrought by the hand of the Lord, believe it not; for\\nthis day he is not a God of miracles; he hath done his work.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:7\\n 7 Yea, and there shall be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and\\nbe merry, for tomorrow we die; and it shall be well with us.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:8\\n 8 And there shall also be many which shall say: Eat, drink, and\\nbe merry; nevertheless, fear God--he will justify in committing a\\nlittle sin; yea, lie a little, take the advantage of one because\\nof his words, dig a pit for thy neighbor; there is no harm in\\nthis; and do all these things, for tomorrow we die; and if it so\\nbe that we are guilty, God will beat us with a few stripes, and\\nat last we shall be saved in the kingdom of God.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:9\\n 9 Yea, and there shall be many which shall teach after this\\nmanner, false and vain and foolish doctrines, and shall be puffed\\nup in their hearts, and shall seek deep to hide their counsels\\nfrom the Lord; and their works shall be in the dark.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:10\\n 10 And the blood of the saints shall cry from the ground against\\nthem.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:11\\n 11 Yea, they have all gone out of the way; they have become\\ncorrupted.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:12\\n 12 Because of pride, and because of false teachers, and false\\ndoctrine, their churches have become corrupted, and their\\nchurches are lifted up; because of pride they are puffed up.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:13\\n 13 They rob the poor because of their fine sanctuaries; they rob\\nthe poor because of their fine clothing; and they persecute the\\nmeek and the poor in heart, because in their pride they are\\npuffed up.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:14\\n 14 They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and because of\\npride, and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have\\nall gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of\\nChrist; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they\\ndo err because they are taught by the precepts of men.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:15\\n 15 O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up\\nin the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false\\ndoctrines, and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the\\nright way of the Lord, wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord\\nGod Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell!\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:16\\n 16 Wo unto them that turn aside the just for a thing of naught\\nand revile against that which is good, and say that is of no\\nworth!  For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily\\nvisit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are\\nfully ripe in iniquity they shall perish.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:17\\n 17 But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of\\ntheir wickedness and abominations they shall not be destroyed,\\nsaith the Lord of Hosts.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:18\\n 18 But behold, that great and abominable church, the whore of\\nall the earth, must tumble to the earth, and great must be the\\nfall thereof.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:19\\n 19 For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which\\nbelong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the\\ndevil will grasp them with his everlasting chains, and they be\\nstirred up to anger, and perish;\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:20\\n 20 For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the\\nchildren of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is\\ngood.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:21\\n 21 And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal\\nsecurity, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion\\nprospereth, all is well--and thus the devil cheateth their souls,\\nand leadeth them away carefully down to hell.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:22\\n 22 And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there\\nis no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is\\nnone--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them\\nwith his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:23\\n 23 Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and\\nhell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must\\nstand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their\\nworks, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them,\\neven a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:24\\n 24 Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:25\\n 25 Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:26\\n 26 Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men,\\nand denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:27\\n 27 Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need\\nno more!\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:28\\n 28 And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry\\nbecause of the truth of God!  For behold, he that is built upon\\nthe rock receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a\\nsandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:29\\n 29 Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of\\nGod, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough!\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:30\\n 30 For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the\\nchildren of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a\\nlittle and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto\\nmy precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall\\nlearn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and\\nfrom them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be\\ntaken away even that which they have.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:31\\n 31 Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh\\nhis arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their\\nprecepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n2 Nephi 28:32\\n 32 Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith the Lord God of Hosts!  For\\nnotwithstanding I shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day\\nto day, they will deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto\\nthem, saith the Lord God, if they will repent and come unto me;\\nfor mine arm is lengthened out all the day long, saith the Lord\\nGod of Hosts.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29\\nChapter 29\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:1\\n 1 But behold, there shall be many--at that day when I shall\\nproceed to do a marvelous work among them, that I may remember my\\ncovenants which I have made unto the children of men, that I may\\nset my hand again the second time to recover my people, which are\\nof the house of Israel;\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:2\\n 2 And also, that I may remember the promises which I have made\\nunto thee, Nephi, and also unto thy father, that I would remember\\nyour seed; and that the words of your seed should proceed forth\\nout of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth\\nunto the ends of the earth, for a standard unto my people, which\\nare of the house of Israel;\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:3\\n 3 And because my words shall hiss forth--many of the Gentiles\\nshall say: A Bible!  A Bible!  We have got a Bible, and there\\ncannot be any more Bible.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:4\\n 4 But thus saith the Lord God: O fools, they shall have a Bible;\\nand it shall proceed forth from the Jews, mine ancient covenant\\npeople.  And what thank they the Jews for the Bible which they\\nreceive from them?  Yea, what do the Gentiles mean?  Do they\\nremember the travails, and the labors, and the pains of the Jews,\\nand their diligence unto me, in bringing forth salvation unto the\\nGentiles?\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:5\\n 5 O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient\\ncovenant people?  Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated\\nthem, and have not sought to recover them.  But behold, I will\\nreturn all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have\\nnot forgotten my people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:6\\n 6 Thou fool, that shall say: A Bible, we have got a Bible, and\\nwe need no more Bible.  Have ye obtained a Bible save it were by\\nthe Jews?\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:7\\n 7 Know ye not that there are more nations than one?  Know ye not\\nthat I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I\\nremember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule\\nin the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth\\nmy word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations\\nof the earth?\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:8\\n 8 Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my\\nword?  Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness\\nunto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto\\nanother?  Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like\\nunto another.  And when the two nations shall run together the\\ntestimony of the two nations shall run together also.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:9\\n 9 And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same\\nyesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words\\naccording to mine own pleasure.  And because that I have spoken\\none word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my\\nwork is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of\\nman, neither from that time henceforth and forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:10\\n 10 Wherefore, because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose\\nthat it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I\\nhave not caused more to be written.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:11\\n 11 For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and\\nin the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea,\\nthat they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out\\nof the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every\\nman according to their works, according to that which is written.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:12\\n 12 For behold, I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write\\nit; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write\\nit; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of\\nIsrael, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I\\nshall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall\\nwrite it.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:13\\n 13 And it shall come to pass that the Jews shall have the words\\nof the Nephites, and the Nephites shall have the words of the\\nJews; and the Nephites and the Jews shall have the words of the\\nlost tribes of Israel; and the lost tribes of Israel shall have\\nthe words of the Nephites and the Jews.\\n\\n2 Nephi 29:14\\n 14 And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the\\nhouse of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their\\npossessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one.  And I\\nwill show unto them that fight against my word and against my\\npeople, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I\\ncovenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30\\nChapter 30\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:1\\n 1 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you;\\nfor I, Nephi, would not suffer that ye should suppose that ye are\\nmore righteous than the Gentiles shall be.  For behold, except ye\\nshall keep the commandments of God ye shall all likewise perish;\\nand because of the words which have been spoken ye need not\\nsuppose that the Gentiles are utterly destroyed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:2\\n 2 For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as\\nwill repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of\\nthe Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord\\ncovenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and\\nbelieve in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:3\\n 3 And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews\\nand the Gentiles.  For after the book of which I have spoken\\nshall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up\\nagain unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the\\nwords which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the\\nremnant of our seed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:4\\n 4 And then shall the remnant of our seed know concerning us, how\\nthat we came out from Jerusalem, and that they are descendants of\\nthe Jews.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:5\\n 5 And the gospel of Jesus Christ shall be declared among them;\\nwherefore, they shall be restored unto the knowledge of their\\nfathers, and also to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, which was had\\namong their fathers.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:6\\n 6 And then shall they rejoice; for they shall know that it is a\\nblessing unto them from the hand of God; and their scales of\\ndarkness shall begin to fall from their eyes; and many\\ngenerations shall not pass away among them, save they shall be a\\npure and delightsome people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:7\\n 7 And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered\\nalso shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to\\ngather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe\\nin Christ shall also become a delightsome people.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:8\\n 8 And it shall come to pass that the Lord God shall commence his\\nwork among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, to bring\\nabout the restoration of his people upon the earth.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:9\\n 9 And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and\\nreprove with equity for the meek of the earth.  And he shall\\nsmite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of\\nhis lips shall he slay the wicked.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:10\\n 10 For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a\\ngreat division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy;\\nand he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must\\ndestroy the wicked by fire.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:11\\n 11 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and\\nfaithfulness the girdle of his reins.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:12\\n 12 And then shall the wolf dwell with the lamb; and the leopard\\nshall lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion,\\nand the fatling, together; and a little child shall lead them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:13\\n 13 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall\\nlie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:14\\n 14 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and\\nthe weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice's den.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:15\\n 15 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain; for\\nthe earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the\\nwaters cover the sea.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:16\\n 16 Wherefore, the things of all nations shall be made known;\\nyea, all things shall be made known unto the children of men.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:17\\n 17 There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed;\\nthere is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in\\nthe light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth\\nsave it shall be loosed.\\n\\n2 Nephi 30:18\\n 18 Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the\\nchildren of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall\\nhave power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a\\nlong time.  And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my\\nsayings.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31\\nChapter 31\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:1\\n 1 And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my\\nbeloved brethren.  And I cannot write but a few things, which I\\nknow must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of\\nthe words of my brother Jacob.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:2\\n 2 Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save\\nit be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of\\nChrist; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to\\nthe plainness of my prophesying.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:3\\n 3 For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner\\ndoth the Lord God work among the children of men.  For the Lord\\nGod giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men\\naccording to their language, unto their understanding.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:4\\n 4 Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken\\nunto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me,\\nthat should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the\\nsins of the world.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:5\\n 5 And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need\\nto be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how\\nmuch more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even\\nby water!\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:6\\n 6 And now, I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the\\nLamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by\\nwater?\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:7\\n 7 Know ye not that he was holy?  But notwithstanding he being\\nholy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the\\nflesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto\\nthe Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his\\ncommandments.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:8\\n 8 Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost\\ndescended upon him in the form of a dove.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:9\\n 9 And again, it showeth unto the children of men the\\nstraightness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by\\nwhich they should enter, he having set the example before them.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:10\\n 10 And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. \\nWherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall\\nbe willing to keep the commandments of the Father?\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:11\\n 11 And the Father said: Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in\\nthe name of my Beloved Son.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:12\\n 12 And also, the voice of the Son came unto me, saying: He that\\nis baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy\\nGhost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things\\nwhich ye have seen me do.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:13\\n 13 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall\\nfollow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy\\nand no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of\\nyour sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take\\nupon you the name of Christ, by baptism--yea, by following your\\nLord and your Savior down into the water, according to his word,\\nbehold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh\\nthe baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak\\nwith the tongue of angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of\\nIsrael.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:14\\n 14 But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the\\nSon unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and\\nwitnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my\\ncommandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the\\nbaptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new\\ntongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this\\nshould deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not\\nknown me.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:15\\n 15 And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words\\nof my Beloved are true and faithful.  He that endureth to the\\nend, the same shall be saved.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:16\\n 16 And now, my beloved brethren, I know by this that unless a\\nman shall endure to the end, in following the example of the Son\\nof the living God, he cannot be saved.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:17\\n 17 Wherefore, do the things which I have told you I have seen\\nthat your Lord and your Redeemer should do; for, for this cause\\nhave they been shown unto me, that ye might know the gate by\\nwhich ye should enter.  For the gate by which ye should enter is\\nrepentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of\\nyour sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:18\\n 18 And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to\\neternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done\\naccording to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye\\nhave received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and\\nthe Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made,\\nthat if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:19\\n 19 And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this\\nstrait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?  Behold, I\\nsay unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by\\nthe word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly\\nupon the merits of him who is mighty to save.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:20\\n 20 Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in\\nChrist, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God\\nand of all men.  Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting\\nupon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus\\nsaith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.\\n\\n2 Nephi 31:21\\n 21 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, this is the way; and\\nthere is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man\\ncan be saved in the kingdom of God.  And now, behold, this is the\\ndoctrine of Christ, and the only and true doctrine of the Father,\\nand of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, which is one God, without\\nend.  Amen.\\n\\n2 Nephi 32\\nChapter 32\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:1\\n 1 And now, behold, my beloved brethren, I suppose that ye ponder\\nsomewhat in your hearts concerning that which ye should do after\\nye have entered in by the way.  But, behold, why do ye ponder\\nthese things in your hearts?\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:2\\n 2 Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had\\nreceived the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels?\\n\\nAnd now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it\\nwere by the Holy Ghost?\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:3\\n 3 Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they\\nspeak the words of Christ.  Wherefore, I said unto you, feast\\nupon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will\\ntell you all things what ye should do.\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:4\\n 4 Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot\\nunderstand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye\\nknock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must\\nperish in the dark.\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:5\\n 5 For behold, again I say unto you that if ye will enter in by\\nthe way, and receive the Holy Ghost, it will show unto you all\\nthings what ye should do.\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:6\\n 6 Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no\\nmore doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto\\nyou in the flesh.  And when he shall manifest himself unto you in\\nthe flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye\\nobserve to do.\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:7\\n 7 And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine\\nutterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and\\nthe wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of\\nmen; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great\\nknowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain\\nas word can be.\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:8\\n 8 And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still\\nin your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning\\nthis thing.  For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which\\nteacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the\\nevil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he\\nmust not pray.\\n\\n2 Nephi 32:9\\n 9 But behold, I say unto you that ye must pray always, and not\\nfaint; that ye must not perform any thing unto the Lord save in\\nthe first place ye shall pray unto the Father in the name of\\nChrist, that he will consecrate thy performance unto thee, that\\nthy performance may be for the welfare of thy soul.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33\\nChapter 33\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:1\\n 1 And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were\\ntaught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto\\nspeaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost\\nthe power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the\\nchildren of men.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:2\\n 2 But behold, there are many that harden their hearts against\\nthe Holy Spirit, that it hath no place in them; wherefore, they\\ncast many things away which are written and esteem them as things\\nof naught.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:3\\n 3 But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem\\nit as of great worth, and especially unto my people.  For I pray\\ncontinually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by\\nnight, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I\\nknow that he will hear my cry.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:4\\n 4 And I know that the Lord God will consecrate my prayers for\\nthe gain of my people.  And the words which I have written in\\nweakness will be made strong unto them; for it persuadeth them to\\ndo good; it maketh known unto them of their fathers; and it\\nspeaketh of Jesus, and persuadeth them to believe in him, and to\\nendure to the end, which is life eternal.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:5\\n 5 And it speaketh harshly against sin, according to the\\nplainness of the truth; wherefore, no man will be angry at the\\nwords which I have written save he shall be of the spirit of the\\ndevil.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:6\\n 6 I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus,\\nfor he hath redeemed my soul from hell.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:7\\n 7 I have charity for my people, and great faith in Christ that I\\nshall meet many souls spotless at his judgment-seat.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:8\\n 8 I have charity for the Jew--I say Jew, because I mean them\\nfrom whence I came.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:9\\n 9 I also have charity for the Gentiles.  But behold, for none of\\nthese can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and\\nenter into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which\\nleads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day\\nof probation.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:10\\n 10 And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends\\nof the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and\\nif ye believe not in these words believe in Christ.  And if ye\\nshall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they\\nare the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they\\nteach all men that they should do good.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:11\\n 11 And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye--for Christ\\nwill show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his\\nwords, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face\\nbefore his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of\\nhim to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:12\\n 12 And I pray the Father in the name of Christ that many of us,\\nif not all, may be saved in his kingdom at that great and last\\nday.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:13\\n 13 And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house\\nof Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the\\nvoice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day\\nshall come.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:14\\n 14 And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and\\nrespect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words\\nwhich shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God,\\nbehold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall\\ncondemn you at the last day.\\n\\n2 Nephi 33:15\\n 15 For what I seal on earth, shall be brought against you at the\\njudgment bar; for thus hath the Lord commanded me, and I must\\nobey.  Amen.\\n\\nJacob\\nTHE BOOK OF JACOB\\nTHE BROTHER OF NEPHI\\nThe words of his preaching unto his brethren.  He confoundeth a\\nman who seeketh to overthrow the doctrine of Christ.  A few words\\nconcerning the history of the people of Nephi.\\n\\nJacob 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\nJacob 1:1\\n 1 For behold, it came to pass that fifty and five years had\\npassed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore,\\nNephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates,\\nupon which these things are engraven.\\n\\nJacob 1:2\\n 2 And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon\\nthese plates a few of the things which I consider to be most\\nprecious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly,\\nconcerning the history of this people which are called the people\\nof Nephi.\\n\\nJacob 1:3\\n 3 For he said that the history of his people should be engraven\\nupon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates\\nand hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.\\n\\nJacob 1:4\\n 4 And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation\\nwhich was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads\\nof them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were\\npossible, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of our people.\\n\\nJacob 1:5\\n 5 For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made\\nmanifest unto us concerning our people, what things should happen\\nunto them.\\n\\nJacob 1:6\\n 6 And we also had many revelations, and the spirit of much\\nprophecy; wherefore, we knew of Christ and his kingdom, which\\nshould come.\\n\\nJacob 1:7\\n 7 Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we\\nmight persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the\\ngoodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any\\nmeans he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as\\nin the provocation in the days of temptation while the children\\nof Israel were in the wilderness.\\n\\nJacob 1:8\\n 8 Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not\\nto rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men\\nwould believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross\\nand bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it\\nupon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.\\n\\nJacob 1:9\\n 9 Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die;\\nwherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his\\npeople now, according to the reigns of the kings.\\n\\nJacob 1:10\\n 10 The people having loved Nephi exceedingly, he having been a\\ngreat protector for them, having wielded the sword of Laban in\\ntheir defence, and having labored in all his days for their\\nwelfare--\\n\\nJacob 1:11\\n 11 Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance\\nhis name.  And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the\\npeople, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the\\nreigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let\\nthem be of whatever name they would.\\n\\nJacob 1:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that Nephi died.\\n\\nJacob 1:13\\n 13 Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites;\\nnevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites,\\nZoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.\\n\\nJacob 1:14\\n 14 But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these\\nnames, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the\\npeople of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call\\nNephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the\\nkings.\\n\\nJacob 1:15\\n 15 And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the\\nreign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and\\nindulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like\\nunto David of old desiring many wives and concubines, and also\\nSolomon, his son.\\n\\nJacob 1:16\\n 16 Yea, and they also began to search much gold and silver, and\\nbegan to be lifted up somewhat in pride.\\n\\nJacob 1:17\\n 17 Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught\\nthem in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the\\nLord.\\n\\nJacob 1:18\\n 18 For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated\\npriests and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.\\n\\nJacob 1:19\\n 19 And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us\\nthe responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own\\nheads if we did not teach them the word of God with all\\ndiligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood\\nmight not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would\\ncome upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the\\nlast day.\\n\\nJacob 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\nJacob 2:1\\n 1 The words which Jacob, the brother of Nephi, spake unto the\\npeople of Nephi, after the death of Nephi:\\n\\nJacob 2:2\\n 2 Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the\\nresponsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office\\nwith soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your sins, I\\ncome up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you\\nthe word of God.\\n\\nJacob 2:3\\n 3 And ye yourselves know that I have hitherto been diligent in\\nthe office of my calling; but I this day am weighed down with\\nmuch more desire and anxiety for the welfare of your souls than I\\nhave hitherto been.\\n\\nJacob 2:4\\n 4 For behold, as yet, ye have been obedient unto the word of the\\nLord, which I have given unto you.\\n\\nJacob 2:5\\n 5 But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of\\nthe all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you\\nconcerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in\\nsin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and\\nabominable unto God.\\n\\nJacob 2:6\\n 6 Yea, it grieveth my soul and causeth me to shrink with shame\\nbefore the presence of my Maker, that I must testify unto you\\nconcerning the wickedness of your hearts.\\n\\nJacob 2:7\\n 7 And also it grieveth me that I must use so much boldness of\\nspeech concerning you, before your wives and your children, many\\nof whose feelings are exceedingly tender and chaste and delicate\\nbefore God, which thing is pleasing unto God;\\n\\nJacob 2:8\\n 8 And it supposeth me that they have come up hither to hear the\\npleasing word of God, yea, the word which healeth the wounded\\nsoul.\\n\\nJacob 2:9\\n 9 Wherefore, it burdeneth my soul that I should be constrained,\\nbecause of the strict commandment which I have received from God,\\nto admonish you according to your crimes, to enlarge the wounds\\nof those who are already wounded, instead of consoling and\\nhealing their wounds; and those who have not been wounded,\\ninstead of feasting upon the pleasing word of God have daggers\\nplaced to pierce their souls and wound their delicate minds.\\n\\nJacob 2:10\\n 10 But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do\\naccording to the strict commands of God, and tell you concerning\\nyour wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in\\nheart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing\\neye of the Almighty God.\\n\\nJacob 2:11\\n 11 Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the\\nplainness of the word of God.  For behold, as I inquired of the\\nLord, thus came the word unto me, saying:  Jacob, get thou up\\ninto the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall\\ngive thee unto this people.\\n\\nJacob 2:12\\n 12 And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare\\nunto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for\\nsilver, and for all manner of precious ores, in the which this\\nland, which is a land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth\\nabound most plentifully.\\n\\nJacob 2:13\\n 13 And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most\\npleasingly, that you have obtained many riches; and because some\\nof you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren\\nye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff\\nnecks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel,\\nand persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better\\nthan they.\\n\\nJacob 2:14\\n 14 And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you\\nin this thing?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay.  But he condemneth\\nyou, and if ye persist in these things his judgments must\\nspeedily come unto you.\\n\\nJacob 2:15\\n 15 O that he would show you that he can pierce you, and with one\\nglance of his eye he can smite you to the dust!\\n\\nJacob 2:16\\n 16 O that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination. \\nAnd, O that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and\\nlet not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!\\n\\nJacob 2:17\\n 17 Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar\\nwith all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like\\nunto you.\\n\\nJacob 2:18\\n 18 But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of\\nGod.\\n\\nJacob 2:19\\n 19 And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain\\nriches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to\\ndo good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to\\nliberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the\\nafflicted.\\n\\nJacob 2:20\\n 20 And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning\\npride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and\\npersecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the\\nthings which God hath given you, what say ye of it?\\n\\nJacob 2:21\\n 21 Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him\\nwho created all flesh?  And the one being is as precious in his\\nsight as the other.  And all flesh is of the dust; and for the\\nselfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his\\ncommandments and glorify him forever.\\n\\nJacob 2:22\\n 22 And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this\\npride.  And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a\\ngrosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.\\n\\nJacob 2:23\\n 23 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser\\ncrimes.  For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to\\nwax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they\\nseek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the\\nthings which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.\\n\\nJacob 2:24\\n 24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and\\nconcubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.\\n\\nJacob 2:25\\n 25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth\\nout of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I\\nmight raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the\\nloins of Joseph.\\n\\nJacob 2:26\\n 26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people\\nshall do like unto them of old.\\n\\nJacob 2:27\\n 27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of\\nthe Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be\\none wife; and concubines he shall have none;\\n\\nJacob 2:28\\n 28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women.  And\\nwhoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of\\nHosts.\\n\\nJacob 2:29\\n 29 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the\\nLord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.\\n\\nJacob 2:30\\n 30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto\\nme, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto\\nthese things.\\n\\nJacob 2:31\\n 31 For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the\\nmourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem,\\nyea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness\\nand abominations of their husbands.\\n\\nJacob 2:32\\n 32 And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the\\ncries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out\\nof the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men\\nof my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.\\n\\nJacob 2:33\\n 33 For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my\\npeople because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with\\na sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit\\nwhoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.\\n\\nJacob 2:34\\n 34 And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments\\nwere given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them\\nbefore; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have\\ndone these things which ye ought not to have done.\\n\\nJacob 2:35\\n 35 Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites,\\nour brethren.  Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives,\\nand lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad\\nexamples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up\\nto God against you.  And because of the strictness of the word of\\nGod, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced\\nwith deep wounds.\\n\\nJacob 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\nJacob 3:1\\n 1 But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in\\nheart.  Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him\\nwith exceeding faith, and he will console you in your\\nafflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice\\nupon those who seek your destruction.\\n\\nJacob 3:2\\n 2 O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and\\nreceive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye\\nmay, if your minds are firm, forever.\\n\\nJacob 3:3\\n 3 But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are\\nfilthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is\\ncursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy\\nlike unto you, nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing,\\nshall scourge you even unto destruction.\\n\\nJacob 3:4\\n 4 And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall\\npossess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead\\naway the righteous out from among you.\\n\\nJacob 3:5\\n 5 Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of\\ntheir filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their\\nskins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten\\nthe commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our\\nfather--that they should have save it were one wife, and\\nconcubines they should have none, and there should not be\\nwhoredoms committed among them.\\n\\nJacob 3:6\\n 6 And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore,\\nbecause of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord\\nGod will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and\\none day they shall become a blessed people.\\n\\nJacob 3:7\\n 7 Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love\\ntheir husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their\\nchildren; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is\\nbecause of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much\\nbetter are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?\\n\\nJacob 3:8\\n 8 O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins\\nthat their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be\\nbrought with them before the throne of God.\\n\\nJacob 3:9\\n 9 Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of\\nGod, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness\\nof their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of\\ntheir filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and\\nremember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.\\n\\nJacob 3:10\\n 10 Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have\\ngrieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set\\nbefore them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your\\nfilthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins\\nbe heaped upon your heads at the last day.\\n\\nJacob 3:11\\n 11 O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of\\nyour souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber\\nof death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may\\nnot become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire\\nand brimstone which is the second death.\\n\\nJacob 3:12\\n 12 And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of\\nNephi, warning them against fornication and lasciviousness, and\\nevery kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.\\n\\nJacob 3:13\\n 13 And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which\\nnow began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates;\\nbut many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates,\\nand their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their\\nkings.\\n\\nJacob 3:14\\n 14 These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were\\nmade by the hand of Nephi.  And I make an end of speaking these\\nwords.\\n\\nJacob 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\nJacob 4:1\\n 1 Now behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered\\nmuch unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a little of\\nmy words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon\\nplates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates\\nmust remain;\\n\\nJacob 4:2\\n 2 But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon\\nplates must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words\\nupon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved\\nbrethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or\\nconcerning their fathers--\\n\\nJacob 4:3\\n 3 Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to\\nengraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved\\nbrethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts,\\nand look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with\\nsorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents.\\n\\nJacob 4:4\\n 4 For, for this intent have we written these things, that they\\nmay know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory\\nmany hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves\\nhad a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which\\nwere before us.\\n\\nJacob 4:5\\n 5 Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in\\nhis name, and also we worship the Father in his name.  And for\\nthis intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to\\nhim; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for\\nrighteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the\\nwilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up\\nhis son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten\\nSon.\\n\\nJacob 4:6\\n 6 Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many\\nrevelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these\\nwitnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken,\\ninsomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the\\nvery trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.\\n\\nJacob 4:7\\n 7 Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may\\nknow that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto\\nthe children of men, that we have power to do these things.\\n\\nJacob 4:8\\n 8 Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord.  How\\nunsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is\\nimpossible that man should find out all his ways.  And no man\\nknoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore,\\nbrethren, despise not the revelations of God.\\n\\nJacob 4:9\\n 9 For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of\\nthe earth, which earth was created by the power of his word. \\nWherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to\\nspeak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the\\nearth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it,\\naccording to his will and pleasure?\\n\\nJacob 4:10\\n 10 Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to\\ntake counsel from his hand.  For behold, ye yourselves know that\\nhe counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over\\nall his works.\\n\\nJacob 4:11\\n 11 Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through\\nthe atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain\\na resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which\\nis in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto\\nGod, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him\\nbefore he manifesteth himself in the flesh.\\n\\nJacob 4:12\\n 12 And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things;\\nfor why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a\\nperfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a\\nresurrection and the world to come?\\n\\nJacob 4:13\\n 13 Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to\\nthe understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and\\nlieth not.  Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are,\\nand of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are\\nmanifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls.  But\\nbehold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also\\nspake them unto prophets of old.\\n\\nJacob 4:14\\n 14 But behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they\\ndespised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and\\nsought for things that they could not understand.  Wherefore,\\nbecause of their blindness, which blindness came by looking\\nbeyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away\\nhis plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things\\nwhich they cannot understand, because they desired it.  And\\nbecause they desired it God hath done it, that they may stumble.\\n\\nJacob 4:15\\n 15 And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying;\\nfor I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that\\nby the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon\\nwhich they might build and have safe foundation.\\n\\nJacob 4:16\\n 16 But behold, according to the scriptures, this stone shall\\nbecome the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation,\\nupon which the Jews can build.\\n\\nJacob 4:17\\n 17 And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after\\nhaving rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that\\nit may become the head of their corner?\\n\\nJacob 4:18\\n 18 Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto\\nyou; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in\\nthe Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.\\n\\nJacob 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\nJacob 5:1\\n 1 Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words\\nof the prophet Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel,\\nsaying:\\n\\nJacob 5:2\\n 2 Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a\\nprophet of the Lord.\\n\\nJacob 5:3\\n 3 For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of\\nIsrael, like unto a tame olive-tree, which a man took and\\nnourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began\\nto decay.\\n\\nJacob 5:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went\\nforth, and he saw that his olive-tree began to decay; and he\\nsaid: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that\\nperhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it\\nperish not.\\n\\nJacob 5:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it,\\nand nourished it according to his word.\\n\\nJacob 5:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that after many days it began to put forth\\nsomewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the\\nmain top thereof began to perish.\\n\\nJacob 5:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it,\\nand he said unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose\\nthis tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild\\nolive-tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off\\nthose main branches which are beginning to wither away, and we\\nwill cast them into the fire that they may be burned.\\n\\nJacob 5:8\\n 8 And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many\\nof these young and tender branches, and I will graft them\\nwhithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that\\nthe root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit\\nthereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and\\ntender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.\\n\\nJacob 5:9\\n 9 Take thou the branches of the wild olive-tree, and graft them\\nin, in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I\\nwill cast into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber\\nthe ground of my vineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord of the\\nvineyard did according to the word of the Lord of the vineyard,\\nand grafted in the branches of the wild olive-tree.\\n\\nJacob 5:11\\n 11 And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged\\nabout, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It\\ngrieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps\\nI might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I\\nmight preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.\\n\\nJacob 5:12\\n 12 Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it,\\naccording to my words.\\n\\nJacob 5:13\\n 13 And these will I place in the nethermost part of my vineyard,\\nwhithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I do it\\nthat I may preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree;\\nand also, that I may lay up fruit thereof against the season,\\nunto myself; for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and\\nthe fruit thereof.\\n\\nJacob 5:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his\\nway, and hid the natural branches of the tame olive-tree in the\\nnethermost parts of the vineyard, some in one and some in\\nanother, according to his will and pleasure.\\n\\nJacob 5:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that a long time passed away, and the\\nLord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down\\ninto the vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard, and also\\nthe servant, went down into the vineyard to labor.  And it came\\nto pass that the servant said unto his master: Behold, look here;\\nbehold the tree.\\n\\nJacob 5:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and\\nbeheld the tree in the which the wild olive branches had been\\ngrafted; and it had sprung forth and begun to bear fruit.  And he\\nbeheld that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the\\nnatural fruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:18\\n 18 And he said unto the servant: Behold, the branches of the\\nwild tree have taken hold of the moisture of the root thereof,\\nthat the root thereof hath brought forth much strength; and\\nbecause of the much strength of the root thereof the wild\\nbranches have brought forth tame fruit.  Now, if we had not\\ngrafted in these branches, the tree thereof would have perished. \\nAnd now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, which the tree\\nthereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up\\nagainst the season, unto mine own self.\\n\\nJacob 5:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto\\nthe servant: Come, let us go to the nethermost part of the\\nvineyard, and behold if the natural branches of the tree have not\\nbrought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit\\nthereof against the season, unto mine own self.\\n\\nJacob 5:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that they went forth whither the master\\nhad hid the natural branches of the tree, and he said unto the\\nservant: Behold these; and he beheld the first that it had\\nbrought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good. \\nAnd he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay\\nit up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own\\nself; for behold, said he, this long time have I nourished it,\\nand it hath brought forth much fruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master:\\nHow comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the\\ntree?  For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy\\nvineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:22\\n 22 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him: Counsel me not; I\\nknew that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto\\nthee, I have nourished it this long time, and thou beholdest that\\nit hath brought forth much fruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto\\nhis servant: Look hither; behold I have planted another branch of\\nthe tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was\\npoorer than the first.  But, behold the tree.  I have nourished\\nit this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit;\\ntherefore, gather it, and lay it up against the season, that I\\nmay preserve it unto mine own self.\\n\\nJacob 5:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said again\\nunto his servant: Look hither, and behold another branch also,\\nwhich I have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and\\nit hath brought forth fruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:25\\n 25 And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the\\nlast.  Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and\\nI have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree\\nhath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree\\nhath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree\\nlike unto the others.\\n\\nJacob 5:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto\\nthe servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth\\ngood fruit, and cast them into the fire.\\n\\nJacob 5:27\\n 27 But behold, the servant said unto him: Let us prune it, and\\ndig about it, and nourish it a little longer, that perhaps it may\\nbring forth good fruit unto thee, that thou canst lay it up\\nagainst the season.\\n\\nJacob 5:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the\\nservant of the Lord of the vineyard did nourish all the fruit of\\nthe vineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that a long time had passed away, and the\\nLord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down\\ninto the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard.  For\\nbehold, the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh;\\nwherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own\\nself.\\n\\nJacob 5:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the\\nservant went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree\\nwhose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches\\nhad been grafted in; and behold all sorts of fruit did cumber the\\ntree.\\n\\nJacob 5:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard did taste\\nof the fruit, every sort according to its number.  And the Lord\\nof the vineyard said: Behold, this long time have we nourished\\nthis tree, and I have laid up unto myself against the season much\\nfruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:32\\n 32 But behold, this time it hath brought forth much fruit, and\\nthere is none of it which is good.  And behold, there are all\\nkinds of bad fruit; and it profiteth me nothing, notwithstanding\\nall our labor; and now it grieveth me that I should lose this\\ntree.\\n\\nJacob 5:33\\n 33 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: What\\nshall we do unto the tree, that I may preserve again good fruit\\nthereof unto mine own self?\\n\\nJacob 5:34\\n 34 And the servant said unto his master: Behold, because thou\\ndidst graft in the branches of the wild olive-tree they have\\nnourished the roots, that they are alive and they have not\\nperished; wherefore thou beholdest that they are yet good.\\n\\nJacob 5:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto\\nhis servant: The tree profiteth me nothing, and the roots thereof\\nprofit me nothing so long as it shall bring forth evil fruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:36\\n 36 Nevertheless, I know that the roots are good, and for mine\\nown purpose I have preserved them; and because of their much\\nstrength they have hitherto brought forth, from the wild\\nbranches, good fruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:37\\n 37 But behold, the wild branches have grown and have overrun the\\nroots thereof; and because that the wild branches have overcome\\nthe roots thereof it hath brought forth much evil fruit; and\\nbecause that it hath brought forth so much evil fruit thou\\nbeholdest that it beginneth to perish; and it will soon become\\nripened, that it may be cast into the fire, except we should do\\nsomething for it to preserve it.\\n\\nJacob 5:38\\n 38 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto\\nhis servant: Let us go down into the nethermost parts of the\\nvineyard, and behold if the natural branches have also brought\\nforth evil fruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:39\\n 39 And it came to pass that they went down into the nethermost\\nparts of the vineyard.  And it came to pass that they beheld that\\nthe fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also; yea,\\nthe first and the second and also the last; and they had all\\nbecome corrupt.\\n\\nJacob 5:40\\n 40 And the wild fruit of the last had overcome that part of the\\ntree which brought forth good fruit, even that the branch had\\nwithered away and died.\\n\\nJacob 5:41\\n 41 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard wept, and\\nsaid unto the servant: What could I have done more for my\\nvineyard?\\n\\nJacob 5:42\\n 42 Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it\\nwere these, had become corrupted.  And now these which have once\\nbrought forth good fruit have also become corrupted; and now all\\nthe trees of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be\\nhewn down and cast into the fire.\\n\\nJacob 5:43\\n 43 And behold this last, whose branch hath withered away, I did\\nplant in a good spot of ground; yea, even that which was choice\\nunto me above all other parts of the land of my vineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:44\\n 44 And thou beheldest that I also cut down that which cumbered\\nthis spot of ground, that I might plant this tree in the stead\\nthereof.\\n\\nJacob 5:45\\n 45 And thou beheldest that a part thereof brought forth good\\nfruit, and a part thereof brought forth wild fruit; and because I\\nplucked not the branches thereof and cast them into the fire,\\nbehold, they have overcome the good branch that it hath withered\\naway.\\n\\nJacob 5:46\\n 46 And now, behold, notwithstanding all the care which we have\\ntaken of my vineyard, the trees thereof have become corrupted,\\nthat they bring forth no good fruit; and these I had hoped to\\npreserve, to have laid up fruit thereof against the season, unto\\nmine own self.  But, behold, they have become like unto the wild\\nolive-tree, and they are of no worth but to be hewn down and cast\\ninto the fire; and it grieveth me that I should lose them.\\n\\nJacob 5:47\\n 47 But what could I have done more in my vineyard?  Have I\\nslackened mine hand, that I have not nourished it, Nay, I have\\nnourished it, and I have digged about it, and I have pruned it,\\nand I have dunged it; and I have stretched forth mine hand almost\\nall the day long, and the end draweth nigh.  And it grieveth me\\nthat I should hew down all the trees of my vineyard, and cast\\nthem into the fire that they should be burned.  Who is it that\\nhas corrupted my vineyard?\\n\\nJacob 5:48\\n 48 And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: Is\\nit not the loftiness of thy vineyard--have not the branches\\nthereof overcome the roots which are good?  And because the\\nbranches have overcome the roots thereof, behold they grew faster\\nthan the strength of the roots, taking strength unto themselves. \\nBehold, I say, is not this the cause that the trees of thy\\nvineyard have become corrupted?\\n\\nJacob 5:49\\n 49 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto\\nthe servant: Let us go to and hew down the trees of the vineyard\\nand cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the\\nground of my vineyard, for I have done all.  What could I have\\ndone more for my vineyard?\\n\\nJacob 5:50\\n 50 But, behold, the servant said unto the Lord of the vineyard:\\nSpare it a little longer.\\n\\nJacob 5:51\\n 51 And the Lord said: Yea, I will spare it a little longer, for\\nit grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my vineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:52\\n 52 Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have\\nplanted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft\\nthem into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from\\nthe tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in\\nthe natural branches of the tree in the stead thereof.\\n\\nJacob 5:53\\n 53 And this will I do that the tree may not perish, that,\\nperhaps, I may preserve unto myself the roots thereof for mine\\nown purpose.\\n\\nJacob 5:54\\n 54 And, behold, the roots of the natural branches of the tree\\nwhich I planted whithersoever I would are yet alive; wherefore,\\nthat I may preserve them also for mine own purpose, I will take\\nof the branches of this tree, and I will graft them in unto them.\\n\\nYea, I will graft in unto them the branches of their mother tree,\\nthat I may preserve the roots also unto mine own self, that when\\nthey shall be sufficiently strong perhaps they may bring forth\\ngood fruit unto me, and I may yet have glory in the fruit of my\\nvineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:55\\n 55 And it came to pass that they took from the natural tree\\nwhich had become wild, and grafted in unto the natural trees,\\nwhich also had become wild.\\n\\nJacob 5:56\\n 56 And they also took of the natural trees which had become\\nwild, and grafted into their mother tree.\\n\\nJacob 5:57\\n 57 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck not\\nthe wild branches from the trees, save it be those which are most\\nbitter; and in them ye shall graft according to that which I have\\nsaid.\\n\\nJacob 5:58\\n 58 And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and we\\nwill trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the\\ntrees those branches which are ripened, that must perish, and\\ncast them into the fire.\\n\\nJacob 5:59\\n 59 And this I do that, perhaps, the roots thereof may take\\nstrength because of their goodness; and because of the change of\\nthe branches, that the good may overcome the evil.\\n\\nJacob 5:60\\n 60 And because that I have preserved the natural branches and\\nthe roots thereof, and that I have grafted in the natural\\nbranches again into their mother tree, and have preserved the\\nroots of their mother tree, that, perhaps, the trees of my\\nvineyard may bring forth again good fruit; and that I may have\\njoy again in the fruit of my vineyard, and, perhaps, that I may\\nrejoice exceedingly that I have preserved the roots and the\\nbranches of the first fruit--\\n\\nJacob 5:61\\n 61 Wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may labor\\ndiligently with our might in the vineyard, that we may prepare\\nthe way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which\\nnatural fruit is good and the most precious above all other\\nfruit.\\n\\nJacob 5:62\\n 62 Wherefore, let us go to and labor with our might this last\\ntime, for behold the end draweth nigh, and this is for the last\\ntime that I shall prune my vineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:63\\n 63 Graft in the branches; begin at the last that they may be\\nfirst, and that the first may be last, and dig about the trees,\\nboth old and young, the first and the last; and the last and the\\nfirst, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.\\n\\nJacob 5:64\\n 64 Wherefore, dig about them, and prune them, and dung them once\\nmore, for the last time, for the end draweth nigh.  And if it be\\nso that these last grafts shall grow, and bring forth the natural\\nfruit, then shall ye prepare the way for them, that they may\\ngrow.\\n\\nJacob 5:65\\n 65 And as they begin to grow ye shall clear away the branches\\nwhich bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the\\ngood and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad\\nthereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong\\nfor the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the\\ntrees of my vineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:66\\n 66 For it grieveth me that I should lose the trees of my\\nvineyard; wherefore ye shall clear away the bad according as the\\ngood shall grow, that the root and the top may be equal in\\nstrength, until the good shall overcome the bad, and the bad be\\nhewn down and cast into the fire, that they cumber not the ground\\nof my vineyard; and thus will I sweep away the bad out of my\\nvineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:67\\n 67 And the branches of the natural tree will I graft in again\\ninto the natural tree;\\n\\nJacob 5:68\\n 68 And the branches of the natural tree will I graft into the\\nnatural branches of the tree; and thus will I bring them together\\nagain, that they shall bring forth the natural fruit, and they\\nshall be one.\\n\\nJacob 5:69\\n 69 And the bad shall be cast away, yea, even out of all the land\\nof my vineyard; for behold, only this once will I prune my\\nvineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:70\\n 70 And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard sent his\\nservant; and the servant went and did as the Lord had commanded\\nhim, and brought other servants; and they were few.\\n\\nJacob 5:71\\n 71 And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor\\nin the vineyard, with your might.  For behold, this is the last\\ntime that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at\\nhand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your\\nmight with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up\\nunto myself against the time which will soon come.\\n\\nJacob 5:72\\n 72 And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with\\ntheir mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with\\nthem; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the\\nvineyard in all things.\\n\\nJacob 5:73\\n 73 And there began to be the natural fruit again in the\\nvineyard; and the natural branches began to grow and thrive\\nexceedingly; and the wild branches began to be plucked off and to\\nbe cast away; and they did keep the root and the top thereof\\nequal, according to the strength thereof.\\n\\nJacob 5:74\\n 74 And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the\\ncommandments of the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had\\nbeen cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved\\nunto himself that the trees had become again the natural fruit;\\nand they became like unto one body; and the fruits were equal;\\nand the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the\\nnatural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the\\nbeginning.\\n\\nJacob 5:75\\n 75 And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw\\nthat his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more\\ncorrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold,\\nfor this last time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou\\nbeholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have\\npreserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was\\nin the beginning.  And blessed art thou; for because ye have been\\ndiligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my\\ncommandments, and have brought unto me again the natural fruit,\\nthat my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away,\\nbehold ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my\\nvineyard.\\n\\nJacob 5:76\\n 76 For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my\\nvineyard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily\\ncometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and\\npruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay\\nup unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to\\nthat which I have spoken.\\n\\nJacob 5:77\\n 77 And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come\\ninto my vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be\\ngathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad\\nwill I cast away into its own place.  And then cometh the season\\nand the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire.\\n\\nJacob 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\nJacob 6:1\\n 1 And now, behold, my brethren, as I said unto you that I would\\nprophesy, behold, this is my prophecy--that the things which this\\nprophet Zenos spake, concerning the house of Israel, in the which\\nhe likened them unto a tame olive-tree, must surely come to pass.\\n\\nJacob 6:2\\n 2 And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time\\nto recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that\\nthe servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish\\nand prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon cometh.\\n\\nJacob 6:3\\n 3 And how blessed are they who have labored diligently in his\\nvineyard; and how cursed are they who shall be cast out into\\ntheir own place!  And the world shall be burned with fire.\\n\\nJacob 6:4\\n 4 And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the\\nhouse of Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth\\nhis hands unto them all the day long; and they are a stiffnecked\\nand a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their\\nhearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God.\\n\\nJacob 6:5\\n 5 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of\\nsoberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of\\nheart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you.  And while\\nhis arm of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day,\\nharden not your hearts.\\n\\nJacob 6:6\\n 6 Yea, today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts;\\nfor why will ye die?\\n\\nJacob 6:7\\n 7 For behold, after ye have been nourished by the good word of\\nGod all the day long, will ye bring forth evil fruit, that ye\\nmust be hewn down and cast into the fire?\\n\\nJacob 6:8\\n 8 Behold, will ye reject these words?  Will ye reject the words\\nof the prophets; and will ye reject all the words which have been\\nspoken concerning Christ, after so many have spoken concerning\\nhim; and deny the good word of Christ, and the power of God, and\\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make\\na mock of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for\\nyou?\\n\\nJacob 6:9\\n 9 Know ye not that if ye will do these things, that the power of\\nthe redemption and the resurrection, which is in Christ, will\\nbring you to stand with shame and awful guilt before the bar of\\nGod?\\n\\nJacob 6:10\\n 10 And according to the power of justice, for justice cannot be\\ndenied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone,\\nwhose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up\\nforever and ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless\\ntorment.\\n\\nJacob 6:11\\n 11 O then, my beloved brethren, repent ye, and enter in at the\\nstrait gate, and continue in the way which is narrow, until ye\\nshall obtain eternal life.\\n\\nJacob 6:12\\n 12 O be wise; what can I say more?\\n\\nJacob 6:13\\n 13 Finally, I bid you farewell, until I shall meet you before\\nthe pleasing bar of God, which bar striketh the wicked with awful\\ndread and fear.  Amen.\\n\\nJacob 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\nJacob 7:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass after some years had passed away,\\nthere came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was\\nSherem.\\n\\nJacob 7:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people,\\nand to declare unto them that there should be no Christ.  And he\\npreached many things which were flattering unto the people; and\\nthis he did that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.\\n\\nJacob 7:3\\n 3 And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts\\nof the people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts; and he\\nknowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he\\nsought much opportunity that he might come unto me.\\n\\nJacob 7:4\\n 4 And he was learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the\\nlanguage of the people; wherefore, he could use much flattery,\\nand much power of speech, according to the power of the devil.\\n\\nJacob 7:5\\n 5 And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding\\nthe many revelations and the many things which I had seen\\nconcerning these things; for I truly had seen angels, and they\\nhad ministered unto me.  And also, I had heard the voice of the\\nLord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore,\\nI could not be shaken.\\n\\nJacob 7:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did\\nhe speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much\\nopportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and\\nalso know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye\\ncall the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.\\n\\nJacob 7:7\\n 7 And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the\\nright way of God, and keep not the law of Moses which is the\\nright way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a\\nbeing which ye say shall come many hundred years hence.  And now\\nbehold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy; for\\nno man knoweth of such things; for he cannot tell of things to\\ncome.  And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.\\n\\nJacob 7:8\\n 8 But behold, the Lord God poured in his Spirit into my soul,\\ninsomuch that I did confound him in all his words.\\n\\nJacob 7:9\\n 9 And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? \\nAnd he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him;\\nbut I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever\\nwill be.\\n\\nJacob 7:10\\n 10 And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures?  And he\\nsaid, Yea.\\n\\nJacob 7:11\\n 11 And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they\\ntruly testify of Christ.  Behold, I say unto you that none of the\\nprophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken\\nconcerning this Christ.\\n\\nJacob 7:12\\n 12 And this is not all--it has been made manifest unto me, for I\\nhave heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me\\nby the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should\\nbe no atonement made all mankind must be lost.\\n\\nJacob 7:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by\\nthis power of the Holy Ghost, in the which ye know so much.\\n\\nJacob 7:14\\n 14 And I said unto him: What am I that I should tempt God to\\nshow unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be true?\\n\\nYet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the devil. \\nNevertheless, not my will be done; but if God shall smite thee,\\nlet that be a sign unto thee that he has power, both in heaven\\nand in earth; and also, that Christ shall come.  And thy will, O\\nLord, be done, and not mine.\\n\\nJacob 7:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had spoken these\\nwords, the power of the Lord came upon him, insomuch that he fell\\nto the earth.  And it came to pass that he was nourished for the\\nspace of many days.\\n\\nJacob 7:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather\\ntogether on the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore, I desire to\\nspeak unto the people before I shall die.\\n\\nJacob 7:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were\\ngathered together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the\\nthings which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and\\nthe power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.\\n\\nJacob 7:18\\n 18 And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by\\nthe power of the devil.  And he spake of hell, and of eternity,\\nand of eternal punishment.\\n\\nJacob 7:19\\n 19 And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable\\nsin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said\\nthat I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him. \\nAnd because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case\\nshall be awful; but I confess unto God.\\n\\nJacob 7:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that when he had said these words he\\ncould say no more, and he gave up the ghost.\\n\\nJacob 7:21\\n 21 And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these\\nthings as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished\\nexceedingly; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them,\\nand they were overcome that they fell to the earth.\\n\\nJacob 7:22\\n 22 Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob, for I had\\nrequested it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had heard my\\ncry and answered my prayer.\\n\\nJacob 7:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was\\nrestored again among the people; and they searched the\\nscriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked\\nman.\\n\\nJacob 7:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim\\nand restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it\\nall was vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they\\nhad an eternal hatred against us, their brethren.  And they\\nsought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.\\n\\nJacob 7:25\\n 25 Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with\\ntheir arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and\\nrock of their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet,\\nconquerors of their enemies.\\n\\nJacob 7:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the\\nrecord of this people being kept on the other plates of Nephi,\\nwherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written\\naccording to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time\\npassed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it\\nwere unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people,\\nwanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a\\nwilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and\\ncontentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.\\n\\nJacob 7:27\\n 27 And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave;\\nwherefore, I said unto my son Enos: Take these plates.  And I\\ntold him the things which my brother Nephi had commanded me, and\\nhe promised obedience unto the commands.  And I make an end of my\\nwriting upon these plates, which writing has been small; and to\\nthe reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may\\nread my words.  Brethren, adieu.\\n\\nEnos 1\\nTHE BOOK OF ENOS\\n\\nEnos 1:1\\n 1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that\\nhe was a just man--for he taught me in his language, and also in\\nthe nurture and admonition of the Lord--and blessed be the name\\nof my God for it--\\n\\nEnos 1:2\\n 2 And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God,\\nbefore I received a remission of my sins.\\n\\nEnos 1:3\\n 3 Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words\\nwhich I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life,\\nand the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.\\n\\nEnos 1:4\\n 4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and\\nI cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own\\nsoul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the\\nnight came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the\\nheavens.\\n\\nEnos 1:5\\n 5 And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are\\nforgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.\\n\\nEnos 1:6\\n 6 And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt\\nwas swept away.\\n\\nEnos 1:7\\n 7 And I said: Lord, how is it done?\\n\\nEnos 1:8\\n 8 And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou\\nhast never before heard nor seen.  And many years pass away\\nbefore he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to,\\nthy faith hath made thee whole.\\n\\nEnos 1:9\\n 9 Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began\\nto feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites;\\nwherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.\\n\\nEnos 1:10\\n 10 And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the\\nvoice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit\\nthy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my\\ncommandments.  I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy\\nland; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity;\\nwherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said;\\nand their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their\\nown heads.\\n\\nEnos 1:11\\n 11 And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to\\nbe unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long\\nstrugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.\\n\\nEnos 1:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with\\nall diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee\\naccording to thy desires, because of thy faith.\\n\\nEnos 1:13\\n 13 And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of\\nhim--that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites,\\nshould fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed,\\nand the Lamanites should not be destroyed, that the Lord God\\nwould preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so\\nbe by the power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth\\nat some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might\\nbe brought unto salvation--\\n\\nEnos 1:14\\n 14 For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring\\nthem to the true faith.  And they swore in their wrath that, if\\nit were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also\\nall the traditions of our fathers.\\n\\nEnos 1:15\\n 15 Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve\\nour records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto\\nme: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye\\nshall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.\\n\\nEnos 1:16\\n 16 And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would\\npreserve the records; and he covenanted with me that he would\\nbring them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time.\\n\\nEnos 1:17\\n 17 And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which\\nhe had made; wherefore my soul did rest.\\n\\nEnos 1:18\\n 18 And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of\\nme this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their\\nfaith; for their faith was like unto thine.\\n\\nEnos 1:19\\n 19 And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the\\npeople of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of\\nthe things which I had heard and seen.\\n\\nEnos 1:20\\n 20 And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek\\ndiligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. \\nBut our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were\\nled by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious,\\nand a bloodthirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness;\\nfeeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering\\nabout in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their\\nloins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and\\nin the cimeter, and the ax.  And many of them did eat nothing\\nsave it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to\\ndestroy us.\\n\\nEnos 1:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the\\nland, and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of\\nherds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and\\ngoats, and wild goats, and also many horses.\\n\\nEnos 1:22\\n 22 And there were exceedingly many prophets among us.  And the\\npeople were a stiffnecked people, hard to understand.\\n\\nEnos 1:23\\n 23 And there was nothing save it was exceeding harshness,\\npreaching and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and\\ndestructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the\\nduration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and\\nall these things--stirring them up continually to keep them in\\nthe fear of the Lord.  I say there was nothing short of these\\nthings, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep\\nthem from going down speedily to destruction.  And after this\\nmanner do I write concerning them.\\n\\nEnos 1:24\\n 24 And I saw wars between the Nephites and Lamanites in the\\ncourse of my days.\\n\\nEnos 1:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that I began to be old, and an hundred\\nand seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our\\nfather Lehi left Jerusalem.\\n\\nEnos 1:26\\n 26 And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been\\nwrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy\\nunto this people, and declare the word according to the truth\\nwhich is in Christ.  And I have declared it in all my days, and\\nhave rejoiced in it above that of the world.\\n\\nEnos 1:27\\n 27 And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my\\nRedeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest.  And I rejoice in\\nthe day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand\\nbefore him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will\\nsay unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared\\nfor you in the mansions of my Father.  Amen.\\n\\nJarom 1\\nTHE BOOK OF JAROM\\n\\nJarom 1:1\\n 1 Now behold, I, Jarom, write a few words according to the\\ncommandment of my father, Enos, that our genealogy may be kept.\\n\\nJarom 1:2\\n 2 And as these plates are small, and as these things are written\\nfor the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites,\\nwherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall\\nnot write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations. \\nFor what could I write more than my fathers have written?  For\\nhave not they revealed the plan of salvation?  I say unto you,\\nYea; and this sufficeth me.\\n\\nJarom 1:3\\n 3 Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this\\npeople, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness\\nof their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the\\nstiffness of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly\\nmerciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the\\nface of the land.\\n\\nJarom 1:4\\n 4 And there are many among us who have many revelations, for\\nthey are not all stiffnecked.  And as many as are not stiffnecked\\nand have faith, have communion with the Holy Spirit, which maketh\\nmanifest unto the children of men, according to their faith.\\n\\nJarom 1:5\\n 5 And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the\\npeople of Nephi had waxed strong in the land.  They observed to\\nkeep the law of Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord. \\nAnd they profaned not; neither did they blaspheme.  And the laws\\nof the land were exceedingly strict.\\n\\nJarom 1:6\\n 6 And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and\\nthe Lamanites also.  And they were exceedingly more numerous than\\nwere they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink\\nthe blood of beasts.\\n\\nJarom 1:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the\\nNephites, to battle.  But our kings and our leaders were mighty\\nmen in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways\\nof the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them\\naway out of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or\\nwhatsoever place of our inheritance.\\n\\nJarom 1:8\\n 8 And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the\\nland, and became exceedingly rich in gold, and in silver, and in\\nprecious things, and in fine workmanship of wood, in buildings,\\nand in machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and\\nsteel, making all manner of tools of every kind to till the\\nground, and weapons of war--yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the\\nquiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for\\nwar.\\n\\nJarom 1:9\\n 9 And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not\\nprosper against us.  But the word of the Lord was verified, which\\nhe spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep\\nmy commandments ye shall prosper in the land.\\n\\nJarom 1:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did\\nthreaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that\\nif they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into\\ntransgression, they should be destroyed from off the face of the\\nland.\\n\\nJarom 1:11\\n 11 Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers,\\ndid labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the\\npeople to diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent\\nfor which it was given; persuading them to look forward unto the\\nMessiah, and believe in him to come as though he already was. \\nAnd after this manner did they teach them.\\n\\nJarom 1:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from\\nbeing destroyed upon the face of the land; for they did prick\\ntheir hearts with the word, continually stirring them up unto\\nrepentance.\\n\\nJarom 1:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that two hundred and thirty and eight\\nyears had passed away--after the manner of wars, and contentions,\\nand dissensions, for the space of much of the time.\\n\\nJarom 1:14\\n 14 And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small. \\nBut behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other plates of Nephi;\\nfor behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven,\\naccording to the writings of the kings, or those which they\\ncaused to be written.\\n\\nJarom 1:15\\n 15 And I deliver these plates into the hands of my son Omni,\\nthat they may be kept according to the commandments of my\\nfathers.\\n\\nOmni 1\\nTHE BOOK OF OMNI\\n\\nOmni 1:1\\n 1 Behold, it came to pass that I, Omni, being commanded by my\\nfather, Jarom, that I should write somewhat upon these plates, to\\npreserve our genealogy--\\n\\nOmni 1:2\\n 2 Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I\\nfought much with the sword to preserve my people, the Nephites,\\nfrom falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites.  But\\nbehold, I of myself am a wicked man, and I have not kept the\\nstatutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have\\ndone.\\n\\nOmni 1:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that two hundred and seventy and six years\\nhad passed away, and we had many seasons of peace; and we had\\nmany seasons of serious war and bloodshed.  Yea, and in fine, two\\nhundred and eighty and two years had passed away, and I had kept\\nthese plates according to the commandments of my fathers; and I\\nconferred them upon my son Amaron.  And I make an end.\\n\\nOmni 1:4\\n 4 And now I, Amaron, write the things whatsoever I write, which\\nare few, in the book of my father.\\n\\nOmni 1:5\\n 5 Behold, it came to pass that three hundred and twenty years\\nhad passed away, and the more wicked part of the Nephites were\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nOmni 1:6\\n 6 For the Lord would not suffer, after he had led them out of\\nthe land of Jerusalem and kept and preserved them from falling\\ninto the hands of their enemies, yea, he would not suffer that\\nthe words should not be verified, which he spake unto our\\nfathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my\\ncommandments ye shall not prosper in the land.\\n\\nOmni 1:7\\n 7 Wherefore, the Lord did visit them in great judgment;\\nnevertheless, he did spare the righteous that they should not\\nperish, but did deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.\\n\\nOmni 1:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that I did deliver the plates unto my\\nbrother Chemish.\\n\\nOmni 1:9\\n 9 Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same\\nbook with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which he wrote,\\nthat he wrote it with his own hand; and he wrote it in the day\\nthat he delivered them unto me.  And after this manner we keep\\nthe records, for it is according to the commandments of our\\nfathers.  And I make an end.\\n\\nOmni 1:10\\n 10 Behold, I, Abinadom, am the son of Chemish.  Behold, it came\\nto pass that I saw much war and contention between my people, the\\nNephites, and the Lamanites; and I, with my own sword, have taken\\nthe lives of many of the Lamanites in the defence of my brethren.\\n\\nOmni 1:11\\n 11 And behold, the record of this people is engraven upon plates\\nwhich is had by the kings, according to the generations; and I\\nknow of no revelation save that which has been written, neither\\nprophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is written.  And I\\nmake an end.\\n\\nOmni 1:12\\n 12 Behold, I am Amaleki, the son of Abinadom.  Behold, I will\\nspeak unto you somewhat concerning Mosiah, who was made king over\\nthe land of Zarahemla; for behold, he being warned of the Lord\\nthat he should flee out of the land of Nephi, and as many as\\nwould hearken unto the voice of the Lord should also depart out\\nof the land with him, into the wilderness--\\n\\nOmni 1:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that he did according as the Lord had\\ncommanded him.  And they departed out of the land into the\\nwilderness, as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord;\\nand they were led by many preachings and prophesyings.  And they\\nwere admonished continually by the word of God; and they were led\\nby the power of his arm, through the wilderness, until they came\\ndown into the land which is called the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nOmni 1:14\\n 14 And they discovered a people, who were called the people of\\nZarahemla.  Now, there was great rejoicing among the people of\\nZarahemla; and also Zarahemla did rejoice exceedingly, because\\nthe Lord had sent the people of Mosiah with the plates of brass\\nwhich contained the record of the Jews.\\n\\nOmni 1:15\\n 15 Behold, it came to pass that Mosiah discovered that the\\npeople of Zarahemla came out from Jerusalem at the time that\\nZedekiah, king of Judah, was carried away captive into Babylon.\\n\\nOmni 1:16\\n 16 And they journeyed in the wilderness, and were brought by the\\nhand of the Lord across the great waters, into the land where\\nMosiah discovered them; and they had dwelt there from that time\\nforth.\\n\\nOmni 1:17\\n 17 And at the time that Mosiah discovered them, they had become\\nexceedingly numerous.  Nevertheless, they had had many wars and\\nserious contentions, and had fallen by the sword from time to\\ntime; and their language had become corrupted; and they had\\nbrought no records with them; and they denied the being of their\\nCreator; and Mosiah, nor the people of Mosiah, could understand\\nthem.\\n\\nOmni 1:18\\n 18 But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be\\ntaught in his language.  And it came to pass that after they were\\ntaught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of\\nhis fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, but\\nnot in these plates.\\n\\nOmni 1:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla, and of\\nMosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah was appointed to be their\\nking.\\n\\nOmni 1:20\\n 20 And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large\\nstone brought unto him with engravings on it; and he did\\ninterpret the engravings by the gift and power of God.\\n\\nOmni 1:21\\n 21 And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of\\nhis people.  And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of\\nZarahemla; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.\\n\\nOmni 1:22\\n 22 It also spake a few words concerning his fathers.  And his\\nfirst parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord\\nconfounded the language of the people; and the severity of the\\nLord fell upon them according to his judgments, which are just;\\nand their bones lay scattered in the land northward.\\n\\nOmni 1:23\\n 23 Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I\\nhave lived to see his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in\\nhis stead.\\n\\nOmni 1:24\\n 24 And behold, I have seen, in the days of king Benjamin, a\\nserious war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the\\nLamanites.  But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage\\nover them; yea, insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of\\nthe land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nOmni 1:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no\\nseed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord,\\nwherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting\\nall men to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in\\nprophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of\\nangels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift\\nof interpreting languages, and in all things which are good; for\\nthere is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord; and\\nthat which is evil cometh from the devil.\\n\\nOmni 1:26\\n 26 And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come\\nunto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his\\nsalvation, and the power of his redemption.  Yea, come unto him,\\nand offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue\\nin fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord\\nliveth ye will be saved.\\n\\nOmni 1:27\\n 27 And now I would speak somewhat concerning a certain number\\nwho went up into the wilderness to return to the land of Nephi;\\nfor there was a large number who were desirous to possess the\\nland of their inheritance.\\n\\nOmni 1:28\\n 28 Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness.  And their\\nleader being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man,\\nwherefore he caused a contention among them; and they were all\\nslain, save fifty, in the wilderness, and they returned again to\\nthe land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nOmni 1:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that they also took others to a\\nconsiderable number, and took their journey again into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nOmni 1:30\\n 30 And I, Amaleki, had a brother, who also went with them; and I\\nhave not since known concerning them.  And I am about to lie down\\nin my grave; and these plates are full.  And I make an end of my\\nspeaking.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1\\nTHE WORDS OF MORMON\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:1\\n 1 And now I, Mormon, being about to deliver up the record which\\nI have been making into the hands of my son Moroni, behold I have\\nwitnessed almost all the destruction of my people, the Nephites.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:2\\n 2 And it is many hundred years after the coming of Christ that I\\ndeliver these records into the hands of my son; and it supposeth\\nme that he will witness the entire destruction of my people.  But\\nmay God grant that he may survive them, that he may write\\nsomewhat concerning them, and somewhat concerning Christ, that\\nperhaps some day it may profit them.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:3\\n 3 And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have\\nwritten; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of\\nNephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki\\nspake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into\\nmy hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small\\naccount of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this\\nking Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:4\\n 4 And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me,\\nbecause of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers\\nknowing that many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also\\nknow that as many things as have been prophesied concerning us\\ndown to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond\\nthis day must surely come to pass--\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:5\\n 5 Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon\\nthem, which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates\\nof Nephi; and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of\\nmy people.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:6\\n 6 But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these\\nprophesyings and revelations, and put them with the remainder of\\nmy record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be\\nchoice unto my brethren.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:7\\n 7 And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me,\\naccording to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in\\nme.  And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all\\nthings which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do\\naccording to his will.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:8\\n 8 And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may\\nonce again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of\\nChrist; that they may once again be a delightsome people.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:9\\n 9 And now I, Mormon, proceed to finish out my record, which I\\ntake from the plates of Nephi; and I make it according to the\\nknowledge and the understanding which God has given me.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:10\\n 10 Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered\\nup these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he took them and\\nput them with the other plates, which contained records which had\\nbeen handed down by the kings, from generation to generation\\nuntil the days of king Benjamin.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:11\\n 11 And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation\\nto generation until they have fallen into my hands.  And I,\\nMormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time\\nhenceforth.  And I know that they will be preserved; for there\\nare great things written upon them, out of which my people and\\ntheir brethren shall be judged at the great and last day,\\naccording to the word of God which is written.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:12\\n 12 And now, concerning this king Benjamin--he had somewhat of\\ncontentions among his own people.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:13\\n 13 And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites\\ncame down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people.\\n\\nBut behold, king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he\\ndid stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his\\nown arm, with the sword of Laban.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:14\\n 14 And in the strength of the Lord they did contend against\\ntheir enemies, until they had slain many thousands of the\\nLamanites.  And it came to pass that they did contend against the\\nLamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of\\ntheir inheritance.\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that after there had been false Christs,\\nand their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to\\ntheir crimes;\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:16\\n 16 And after there had been false prophets, and false preachers\\nand teachers among the people, and all these having been punished\\naccording to their crimes; and after there having been much\\ncontention and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites, behold,\\nit came to pass that king Benjamin, with the assistance of the\\nholy prophets who were among his people--\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:17\\n 17 For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign\\nover his people in righteousness; and there were many holy men in\\nthe land, and they did speak the word of God with power and with\\nauthority; and they did use much sharpness because of the\\nstiffneckedness of the people--\\n\\nWords of Mormon 1:18\\n 18 Wherefore, with the help of these, king Benjamin, by laboring\\nwith all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul,\\nand also the prophets, did once more establish peace in the land.\\n\\nMosiah\\nTHE BOOK OF MOSIAH\\n\\nMosiah 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\nMosiah 1:1\\n 1 And now there was no more contention in all the land of\\nZarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so\\nthat king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his\\ndays.\\n\\nMosiah 1:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called\\ntheir names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman.  And he caused that\\nthey should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that\\nthereby they might become men of understanding; and that they\\nmight know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the\\nmouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of\\nthe Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 1:3\\n 3 And he also taught them concerning the records which were\\nengraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye\\nshould remember that were it not for these plates, which contain\\nthese records and these commandments, we must have suffered in\\nignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries\\nof God.\\n\\nMosiah 1:4\\n 4 For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have\\nremembered all these things, to have taught them to his children,\\nexcept it were for the help of these plates; for he having been\\ntaught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read\\nthese engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby\\nthey could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the\\ncommandments of God, even down to this present time.\\n\\nMosiah 1:5\\n 5 I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which\\nhave been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might\\nread and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments\\nalways before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled\\nin unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the\\nLamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do\\nnot believe them when they are taught them, because of the\\ntraditions of their fathers, which are not correct.\\n\\nMosiah 1:6\\n 6 O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings\\nare true, and also that these records are true.  And behold, also\\nthe plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of\\nour fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they\\nare true; and we can know of their surety because we have them\\nbefore our eyes.\\n\\nMosiah 1:7\\n 7 And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search\\nthem diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye\\nshould keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the\\nland according to the promises which the Lord made unto our\\nfathers.\\n\\nMosiah 1:8\\n 8 And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which\\nare not written in this book.\\n\\nMosiah 1:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end\\nof teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must\\nvery soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it\\nexpedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.\\n\\nMosiah 1:10\\n 10 Therefore, he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are\\nthe words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that\\nye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all\\nthis people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah\\nwho dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered\\ntogether; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people\\nout of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this\\npeople, whom the Lord our God hath given us.\\n\\nMosiah 1:11\\n 11 And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby\\nthey may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God\\nhath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because\\nthey have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of\\nthe Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 1:12\\n 12 And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out,\\nexcept it be through transgression.\\n\\nMosiah 1:13\\n 13 Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored\\npeople of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a\\nwicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them\\nup, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and\\nhe will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous\\npower, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.\\n\\nMosiah 1:14\\n 14 For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in\\nthe preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the\\nhands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.\\n\\nMosiah 1:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end\\nof these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning\\nall the affairs of the kingdom.\\n\\nMosiah 1:16\\n 16 And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records\\nwhich were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates\\nof Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director,\\nwhich led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared\\nby the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one\\naccording to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.\\n\\nMosiah 1:17\\n 17 Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor\\nprogress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the\\ndispleasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten\\nwith famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance\\nof their duty.\\n\\nMosiah 1:18\\n 18 And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his\\nfather had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who\\nwere in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather\\nthemselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words\\nwhich his father should speak unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\nMosiah 2:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father\\nhad commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the\\nland, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all\\nthe land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words\\nwhich king Benjamin should speak unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 2:2\\n 2 And there were a great number, even so many that they did not\\nnumber them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great\\nin the land.\\n\\nMosiah 2:3\\n 3 And they also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that\\nthey might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the\\nlaw of Moses;\\n\\nMosiah 2:4\\n 4 And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God,\\nwho had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had\\ndelivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had\\nappointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just man to\\nbe their king, who had established peace in the land of\\nZarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the commandments of\\nGod, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God\\nand all men.\\n\\nMosiah 2:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they\\npitched their tents round about, every man according to his\\nfamily, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters,\\nand their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the\\nyoungest, every family being separate one from another.\\n\\nMosiah 2:6\\n 6 And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man\\nhaving his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that\\nthereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which\\nking Benjamin should speak unto them;\\n\\nMosiah 2:7\\n 7 For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not\\nteach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he\\ncaused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear\\nthe words which he should speak unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 2:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from\\nthe tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the\\ngreatness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words\\nwhich he spake should be written and sent forth among those that\\nwere not under the sound of his voice, that they might also\\nreceive his words.\\n\\nMosiah 2:9\\n 9 And these are the words which he spake and caused to be\\nwritten, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled\\nyourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall\\nspeak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up\\nhither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you\\nshould hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and\\nyour hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the\\nmysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.\\n\\nMosiah 2:10\\n 10 I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should\\nfear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a\\nmortal man.\\n\\nMosiah 2:11\\n 11 But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of\\ninfirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this\\npeople, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the\\nhand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this\\npeople; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power,\\nto serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord\\nhath granted unto me.\\n\\nMosiah 2:12\\n 12 I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days\\nin your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold\\nnor silver nor any manner of riches of you;\\n\\nMosiah 2:13\\n 13 Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in\\ndungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that\\nye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor\\neven have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of\\nwickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the\\ncommandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded\\nyou--\\n\\nMosiah 2:14\\n 14 And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I\\nmight serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and\\nthat there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be\\nborne--and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves\\nare witnesses this day.\\n\\nMosiah 2:15\\n 15 Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might\\nboast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse\\nyou; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can\\nanswer a clear conscience before God this day.\\n\\nMosiah 2:16\\n 16 Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I\\nhad spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for\\nI have only been in the service of God.\\n\\nMosiah 2:17\\n 17 And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom;\\nthat ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow\\nbeings ye are only in the service of your God.\\n\\nMosiah 2:18\\n 18 Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call\\nyour king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to\\nserve one another?\\n\\nMosiah 2:19\\n 19 And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent\\nhis days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God,\\ndo merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your\\nheavenly King!\\n\\nMosiah 2:20\\n 20 I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all\\nthe thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess,\\nto that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you,\\nand has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye\\nshould live in peace one with another--\\n\\nMosiah 2:21\\n 21 I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created\\nyou from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by\\nlending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to\\nyour own will, and even supporting you from one moment to\\nanother--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls\\nyet ye would be unprofitable servants.\\n\\nMosiah 2:22\\n 22 And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his\\ncommandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his\\ncommandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth\\nvary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his\\ncommandments he doth bless you and prosper you.\\n\\nMosiah 2:23\\n 23 And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted\\nunto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.\\n\\nMosiah 2:24\\n 24 And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath\\ncommanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you;\\nand therefore he hath paid you.  And ye are still indebted unto\\nhim, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what\\nhave ye to boast?\\n\\nMosiah 2:25\\n 25 And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves?  I answer you,\\nNay.  Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the\\nearth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold,\\nit belongeth to him who created you.\\n\\nMosiah 2:26\\n 26 And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye\\nyourselves are; for I am also of the dust.  And ye behold that I\\nam old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother\\nearth.\\n\\nMosiah 2:27\\n 27 Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking\\nwith a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have\\ncaused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might\\nbe found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me,\\nwhen I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he\\nhath commanded me concerning you.\\n\\nMosiah 2:28\\n 28 I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble\\nyourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood,\\nat this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave,\\nthat I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join\\nthe choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.\\n\\nMosiah 2:29\\n 29 And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye\\nshould assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto\\nyou that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;\\n\\nMosiah 2:30\\n 30 For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble\\nexceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God\\ndoth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto\\nyou, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this\\nday, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.\\n\\nMosiah 2:31\\n 31 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have\\nhitherto done.  As ye have kept my commandments, and also the\\ncommandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept\\nfrom falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall\\nkeep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which\\nshall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land,\\nand your enemies shall have no power over you.\\n\\nMosiah 2:32\\n 32 But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions\\namong you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken\\nof by my father Mosiah.\\n\\nMosiah 2:33\\n 33 For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to\\nobey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth\\nand dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own\\nsoul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment,\\nhaving transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.\\n\\nMosiah 2:34\\n 34 I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it\\nbe your little children that have not been taught concerning\\nthese things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to\\nyour heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are;\\nand also have been taught concerning the records which contain\\nthe prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even\\ndown to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;\\n\\nMosiah 2:35\\n 35 And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. \\nAnd behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the\\nLord; therefore, they are just and true.\\n\\nMosiah 2:36\\n 36 And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have\\nknown and have been taught all these things, if ye should\\ntransgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye\\ndo withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may\\nhave no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may\\nbe blessed, prospered, and preserved--\\n\\nMosiah 2:37\\n 37 I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh\\nout in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey\\nthe evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness;\\ntherefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in\\nunholy temples.\\n\\nMosiah 2:38\\n 38 Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth\\nan enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his\\nimmortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth\\ncause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill\\nhis breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an\\nunquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.\\n\\nMosiah 2:39\\n 39 And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man;\\ntherefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.\\n\\nMosiah 2:40\\n 40 O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little\\nchildren who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly\\nunto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to\\na remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen\\ninto transgression.\\n\\nMosiah 2:41\\n 41 And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the\\nblessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of\\nGod.  For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal\\nand spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are\\nreceived into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a\\nstate of never-ending happiness.  O remember, remember that these\\nthings are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.\\n\\nMosiah 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\nMosiah 3:1\\n 1 And again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have\\nsomewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to\\ntell you concerning that which is to come.\\n\\nMosiah 3:2\\n 2 And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me\\nby an angel from God.  And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke,\\nand behold he stood before me.\\n\\nMosiah 3:3\\n 3 And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall\\ntell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad\\ntidings of great joy.\\n\\nMosiah 3:4\\n 4 For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy\\nrighteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou\\nmayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people,\\nthat they may also be filled with joy.\\n\\nMosiah 3:5\\n 5 For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with\\npower, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all\\neternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the\\nchildren of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and\\nshall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as\\nhealing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the\\nblind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing\\nall manner of diseases.\\n\\nMosiah 3:6\\n 6 And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell\\nin the hearts of the children of men.\\n\\nMosiah 3:7\\n 7 And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger,\\nthirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be\\nunto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great\\nshall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of\\nhis people.\\n\\nMosiah 3:8\\n 8 And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the\\nFather of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the\\nbeginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.\\n\\nMosiah 3:9\\n 9 And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto\\nthe children of men even through faith on his name; and even\\nafter all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he\\nhath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.\\n\\nMosiah 3:10\\n 10 And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he\\nstandeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are\\ndone that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of\\nmen.\\n\\nMosiah 3:11\\n 11 For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those\\nwho have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not\\nknowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly\\nsinned.\\n\\nMosiah 3:12\\n 12 But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against\\nGod!  For salvation cometh to none such except it be through\\nrepentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.\\n\\nMosiah 3:13\\n 13 And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the\\nchildren of men, to declare these things to every kindred,\\nnation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that\\nChrist should come, the same might receive remission of their\\nsins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he\\nhad already come among them.\\n\\nMosiah 3:14\\n 14 Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked\\npeople, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.\\n\\nMosiah 3:15\\n 15 And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he\\nunto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake\\nunto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their\\nhearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing\\nexcept it were through the atonement of his blood.\\n\\nMosiah 3:16\\n 16 And even if it were possible that little children could sin\\nthey could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for\\nbehold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of\\nChrist atoneth for their sins.\\n\\nMosiah 3:17\\n 17 And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other\\nname given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come\\nunto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ,\\nthe Lord Omnipotent.\\n\\nMosiah 3:18\\n 18 For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the\\ninfant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink\\ndamnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and\\nbecome as little children, and believe that salvation was, and\\nis, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ,\\nthe Lord Omnipotent.\\n\\nMosiah 3:19\\n 19 For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the\\nfall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to\\nthe enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man\\nand becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord,\\nand becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full\\nof love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit\\nto inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.\\n\\nMosiah 3:20\\n 20 And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come when\\nthe knowledge of the Savior shall spread throughout every nation,\\nkindred, tongue, and people.\\n\\nMosiah 3:21\\n 21 And behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found\\nblameless before God, except it be little children, only through\\nrepentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent.\\n\\nMosiah 3:22\\n 22 And even at this time, when thou shalt have taught thy people\\nthe things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, even then\\nare they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only\\naccording to the words which I have spoken unto thee.\\n\\nMosiah 3:23\\n 23 And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath\\ncommanded me.\\n\\nMosiah 3:24\\n 24 And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright\\ntestimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they\\nshall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they\\nbe good, or whether they be evil.\\n\\nMosiah 3:25\\n 25 And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of\\ntheir own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink\\nfrom the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless\\ntorment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have\\ndrunk damnation to their own souls.\\n\\nMosiah 3:26\\n 26 Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of\\nGod, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could\\ndeny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the\\nforbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no\\nmore forever.\\n\\nMosiah 3:27\\n 27 And their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose\\nflames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and\\never.  Thus hath the Lord commanded me.  Amen.\\n\\nMosiah 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\nMosiah 4:1\\n 1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an\\nend of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by\\nthe angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the\\nmultitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear\\nof the Lord had come upon them.\\n\\nMosiah 4:2\\n 2 And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even\\nless than the dust of the earth.  And they all cried aloud with\\none voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of\\nChrist that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our\\nhearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son\\nof God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall\\ncome down among the children of men.\\n\\nMosiah 4:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the\\nSpirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy,\\nhaving received a remission of their sins, and having peace of\\nconscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in\\nJesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king\\nBenjamin had spoken unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 4:4\\n 4 And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak\\nunto them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my\\npeople, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and\\nunderstand the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto\\nyou.\\n\\nMosiah 4:5\\n 5 For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this\\ntime has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your\\nworthless and fallen state--\\n\\nMosiah 4:6\\n 6 I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness\\nof God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his\\npatience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and\\nalso, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation\\nof the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that\\nshould put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in\\nkeeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the\\nend of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body--\\n\\nMosiah 4:7\\n 7 I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through\\nthe atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world\\nfor all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who\\nare, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.\\n\\nMosiah 4:8\\n 8 And this is the means whereby salvation cometh.  And there is\\nnone other salvation save this which hath been spoken of; neither\\nare there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the\\nconditions which I have told you.\\n\\nMosiah 4:9\\n 9 Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all\\nthings, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all\\nwisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that\\nman doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can\\ncomprehend.\\n\\nMosiah 4:10\\n 10 And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and\\nforsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in\\nsincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you\\nbelieve all these things see that ye do them.\\n\\nMosiah 4:11\\n 11 And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye\\nhave come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have\\nknown of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have\\nreceived a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly\\ngreat joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember,\\nand always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your\\nown nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you,\\nunworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of\\nhumility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing\\nsteadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was\\nspoken by the mouth of the angel.\\n\\nMosiah 4:12\\n 12 And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always\\nrejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a\\nremission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the\\nglory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which\\nis just and true.\\n\\nMosiah 4:13\\n 13 And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to\\nlive peaceably, and to render to every man according to that\\nwhich is his due.\\n\\nMosiah 4:14\\n 14 And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or\\nnaked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of\\nGod, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil,\\nwho is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath\\nbeen spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all\\nrighteousness.\\n\\nMosiah 4:15\\n 15 But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and\\nsoberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve\\none another.\\n\\nMosiah 4:16\\n 16 And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need\\nof your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him\\nthat standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar\\nputteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to\\nperish.\\n\\nMosiah 4:17\\n 17 Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his\\nmisery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him\\nof my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not\\nsuffer, for his punishments are just--\\n\\nMosiah 4:18\\n 18 But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath\\ngreat cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he\\nhath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the\\nkingdom of God.\\n\\nMosiah 4:19\\n 19 For behold, are we not all beggars?  Do we not all depend\\nupon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we\\nhave, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver,\\nand for all the riches which we have of every kind?\\n\\nMosiah 4:20\\n 20 And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his\\nname, and begging for a remission of your sins.  And has he\\nsuffered that ye have begged in vain?  Nay; he has poured out his\\nSpirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled\\nwith joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that\\nye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.\\n\\nMosiah 4:21\\n 21 And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are\\ndependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth\\ngrant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith,\\nbelieving that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart\\nof the substance that ye have one to another.\\n\\nMosiah 4:22\\n 22 And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you\\nfor your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much\\nmore just will be your condemnation for withholding your\\nsubstance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also\\nyour life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of\\nthe thing which thou hast done.\\n\\nMosiah 4:23\\n 23 I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall\\nperish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are\\nrich as pertaining to the things of this world.\\n\\nMosiah 4:24\\n 24 And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have\\nsufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who\\ndeny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your\\nhearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would\\ngive.\\n\\nMosiah 4:25\\n 25 And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless,\\notherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye\\ncovet that which ye have not received.\\n\\nMosiah 4:26\\n 26 And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken\\nunto you--that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your\\nsins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God--I\\nwould that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every\\nman according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry,\\nclothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their\\nrelief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their\\nwants.\\n\\nMosiah 4:27\\n 27 And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order;\\nfor it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has\\nstrength.  And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent,\\nthat thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must\\nbe done in order.\\n\\nMosiah 4:28\\n 28 And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you\\nborroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he\\nborroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit\\nsin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin\\nalso.\\n\\nMosiah 4:29\\n 29 And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may\\ncommit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many\\nthat I cannot number them.\\n\\nMosiah 4:30\\n 30 But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch\\nyourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds,\\nand observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of\\nwhat ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto\\nthe end of your lives, ye must perish.  And now, O man, remember,\\nand perish not.\\n\\nMosiah 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\nMosiah 5:1\\n 1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus\\nspoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his\\npeople if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 5:2\\n 2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all\\nthe words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of\\ntheir surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord\\nOmnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our\\nhearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do\\ngood continually.\\n\\nMosiah 5:3\\n 3 And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God,\\nand the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that\\nwhich is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all\\nthings.\\n\\nMosiah 5:4\\n 4 And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our\\nking has spoken unto us that has brought us to this great\\nknowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy.\\n\\nMosiah 5:5\\n 5 And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do\\nhis will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things\\nthat he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we\\nmay not bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been\\nspoken by the angel, that we may not drink out of the cup of the\\nwrath of God.\\n\\nMosiah 5:6\\n 6 And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of\\nthem; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words\\nthat I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a\\nrighteous covenant.\\n\\nMosiah 5:7\\n 7 And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall\\nbe called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters;\\nfor behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say\\nthat your hearts are changed through faith on his name;\\ntherefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his\\ndaughters.\\n\\nMosiah 5:8\\n 8 And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other\\nhead whereby ye can be made free.  There is no other name given\\nwhereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take\\nupon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the\\ncovenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your\\nlives.\\n\\nMosiah 5:9\\n 9 And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be\\nfound at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by\\nwhich he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.\\n\\nMosiah 5:10\\n 10 And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take\\nupon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name;\\ntherefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God.\\n\\nMosiah 5:11\\n 11 And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the\\nname that I said I should give unto you that never should be\\nblotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take\\nheed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out\\nof your hearts.\\n\\nMosiah 5:12\\n 12 I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the\\nname written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the\\nleft hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye\\nshall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.\\n\\nMosiah 5:13\\n 13 For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and\\nwho is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and\\nintents of his heart?\\n\\nMosiah 5:14\\n 14 And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his\\nneighbor, and keep him?  I say unto you, Nay; he will not even\\nsuffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him\\naway, and cast him out.  I say unto you, that even so shall it be\\namong you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.\\n\\nMosiah 5:15\\n 15 Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable,\\nalways abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God\\nOmnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven,\\nthat ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through\\nthe wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created\\nall things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all.  Amen.\\n\\nMosiah 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\nMosiah 6:1\\n 1 And now, king Benjamin thought it was expedient, after having\\nfinished speaking to the people, that he should take the names of\\nall those who had entered into a covenant with God to keep his\\ncommandments.\\n\\nMosiah 6:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it\\nwere little children, but who had entered into the covenant and\\nhad taken upon them the name of Christ.\\n\\nMosiah 6:3\\n 3 And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an\\nend of all these things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah to be\\na ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the\\ncharges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to\\nteach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the\\ncommandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the\\noath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they\\nreturned, every one, according to their families, to their own\\nhouses.\\n\\nMosiah 6:4\\n 4 And Mosiah began to reign in his father's stead.  And he began\\nto reign in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole,\\nabout four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi\\nleft Jerusalem.\\n\\nMosiah 6:5\\n 5 And king Benjamin lived three years and he died.\\n\\nMosiah 6:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that king Mosiah did walk in the ways of\\nthe Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did\\nkeep his commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him.\\n\\nMosiah 6:7\\n 7 And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should till the\\nearth.  And he also, himself, did till the earth, that thereby he\\nmight not become burdensome to his people, that he might do\\naccording to that which his father had done in all things.  And\\nthere was no contention among all his people for the space of\\nthree years.\\n\\nMosiah 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\nMosiah 7:1\\n 1 And now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had\\ncontinual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to\\nknow concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of\\nLehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had\\nheard nothing from them from the time they left the land of\\nZarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.\\n\\nMosiah 7:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted that sixteen of\\ntheir strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi to inquire\\nconcerning their brethren.\\n\\nMosiah 7:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up,\\nhaving with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man, and\\na descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.\\n\\nMosiah 7:4\\n 4 And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the\\nwilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they\\nwandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they\\nwander.\\n\\nMosiah 7:5\\n 5 And when they had wandered forty days they came to a hill,\\nwhich is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched\\ntheir tents.\\n\\nMosiah 7:6\\n 6 And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were\\nAmaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of\\nNephi.\\n\\nMosiah 7:7\\n 7 And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the\\nland of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were\\nsurrounded by the king's guard, and were taken, and were bound,\\nand were committed to prison.\\n\\nMosiah 7:8\\n 8 And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they\\nwere again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed;\\nand they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather\\ncommanded, that they should answer the questions which he should\\nask them.\\n\\nMosiah 7:9\\n 9 And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah,\\nwho was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of\\nZarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their\\nfathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.\\n\\nMosiah 7:10\\n 10 And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold\\nas to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with\\nmy guards without the gate?\\n\\nMosiah 7:11\\n 11 And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be\\npreserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have\\ncaused that my guards should have put you to death.  Ye are\\npermitted to speak.\\n\\nMosiah 7:12\\n 12 And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he\\nwent forth and bowed himself before the king; and rising again he\\nsaid: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am\\nyet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to\\nspeak with boldness;\\n\\nMosiah 7:13\\n 13 For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have\\nsuffered that I should have worn these bands.  For I am Ammon,\\nand am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the\\nland of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff\\nbrought up out of that land.\\n\\nMosiah 7:14\\n 14 And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words\\nof Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a\\nsurety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet\\nalive.  And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause\\nthat my people shall rejoice also.\\n\\nMosiah 7:15\\n 15 For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed\\nwith a tax which is grievous to be borne.  And now, behold, our\\nbrethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands\\nof the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better\\nthat we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king\\nof the Lamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 7:16\\n 16 And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no\\nmore bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go\\nto the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren\\ninto the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest\\nthemselves from the labors of their journey; for they had\\nsuffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and\\nfatigue.\\n\\nMosiah 7:17\\n 17 And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a\\nproclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather\\nthemselves together to the temple to hear the words which he\\nshould speak unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 7:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves\\ntogether that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my\\npeople, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time\\nis at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in\\nsubjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings,\\nwhich have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual\\nstruggle to be made.\\n\\nMosiah 7:19\\n 19 Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your\\ntrust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac,\\nand Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel\\nout of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk\\nthrough the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that\\nthey might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did\\nhe do for them.\\n\\nMosiah 7:20\\n 20 And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the\\nland of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even\\nuntil now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and\\nabominations that he has brought us into bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 7:21\\n 21 And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made\\nking over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land\\nof his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and\\ncraftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with\\nking Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions\\nof a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the\\ncity of Shilom; and the land round about--\\n\\nMosiah 7:22\\n 22 And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this\\npeople into subjection or into bondage.  And behold, we at this\\ntime do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount\\nof one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain\\nof every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our\\nherds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of\\nthe Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.\\n\\nMosiah 7:23\\n 23 And now, is not this grievous to be borne?  And is not this,\\nour affliction, great?  Now behold, how great reason we have to\\nmourn.\\n\\nMosiah 7:24\\n 24 Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to\\nmourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and\\ntheir blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.\\n\\nMosiah 7:25\\n 25 For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord\\nwould not have suffered that this great evil should come upon\\nthem.  But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but\\nthere arose contentions among them, even so much that they did\\nshed blood among themselves.\\n\\nMosiah 7:26\\n 26 And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man\\nof God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and\\nprophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming\\nof Christ.\\n\\nMosiah 7:27\\n 27 And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the\\nFather of all things, and said that he should take upon him the\\nimage of man, and it should be the image after which man was\\ncreated in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was\\ncreated after the image of God, and that God should come down\\namong the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and\\ngo forth upon the face of the earth--\\n\\nMosiah 7:28\\n 28 And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and\\nmany more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God\\nupon them.  Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage,\\nand that they are smitten with sore afflictions?\\n\\nMosiah 7:29\\n 29 For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people\\nin the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways\\nthat they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling\\nblock before them.\\n\\nMosiah 7:30\\n 30 And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they\\nshall reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect\\nthereof is poison.\\n\\nMosiah 7:31\\n 31 And again he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they\\nshall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.\\n\\nMosiah 7:32\\n 32 And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye\\nare smitten and afflicted.\\n\\nMosiah 7:33\\n 33 But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart,\\nand put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of\\nmind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and\\npleasure, deliver you out of bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\nMosiah 8:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of\\nspeaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and\\nonly a few of them have I written in this book, he told his\\npeople all the things concerning their brethren who were in the\\nland of Zarahemla.\\n\\nMosiah 8:2\\n 2 And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude,\\nand rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren\\nfrom the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the\\ntime that he himself came up out of the land.\\n\\nMosiah 8:3\\n 3 And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king\\nBenjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of\\nking Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he\\nspake.\\n\\nMosiah 8:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king\\nLimhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return\\nevery one unto his own house.\\n\\nMosiah 8:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which\\ncontained the record of his people from the time that they left\\nthe land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he\\nmight read them.\\n\\nMosiah 8:6\\n 6 Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired\\nof him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told\\nhim that he could not.\\n\\nMosiah 8:7\\n 7 And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions\\nof my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should\\ntake a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find\\nthe land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to\\ndeliver us out of bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 8:8\\n 8 And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many\\ndays, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla\\nbut returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many\\nwaters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of\\nmen, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings\\nof every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled\\nwith a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.\\n\\nMosiah 8:9\\n 9 And for a testimony that the things that they had said are\\ntrue they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with\\nengravings, and they are of pure gold.\\n\\nMosiah 8:10\\n 10 And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are\\nlarge, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly\\nsound.\\n\\nMosiah 8:11\\n 11 And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have\\nperished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and\\nthere is no one in the land that is able to interpret the\\nlanguage or the engravings that are on the plates.  Therefore I\\nsaid unto thee: Canst thou translate?\\n\\nMosiah 8:12\\n 12 And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can\\ntranslate?  For I am desirous that these records should be\\ntranslated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a\\nknowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed,\\nfrom whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a\\nknowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am\\ndesirous to know the cause of their destruction.\\n\\nMosiah 8:13\\n 13 Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king,\\nof a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith\\nthat he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient\\ndate; and it is a gift from God.  And the things are called\\ninterpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded,\\nlest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. \\nAnd whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called\\nseer.\\n\\nMosiah 8:14\\n 14 And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of\\nZarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and\\nwho has this high gift from God.\\n\\nMosiah 8:15\\n 15 And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.\\n\\nMosiah 8:16\\n 16 And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also;\\nand a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should\\npossess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have\\ngreat power given him from God.\\n\\nMosiah 8:17\\n 17 But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of\\nthings which are to come, and by them shall all things be\\nrevealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and\\nhidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known\\nshall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known\\nby them which otherwise could not be known.\\n\\nMosiah 8:18\\n 18 Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might\\nwork mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to\\nhis fellow beings.\\n\\nMosiah 8:19\\n 19 And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words\\nthe king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying:\\nDoubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and\\nthese interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of\\nunfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.\\n\\nMosiah 8:20\\n 20 O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth\\nhe suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable\\nare the understandings of the children of men; for they will not\\nseek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over\\nthem!\\n\\nMosiah 8:21\\n 21 Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd,\\nand scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of\\nthe forest.\\n\\nMosiah 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\nMosiah 9:1\\n 1 I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the\\nNephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of\\nthe land of our fathers' first inheritance, and having been sent\\nas a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces,\\nthat our army might come upon them and destroy them--but when I\\nsaw that which was good among them I was desirous that they\\nshould not be destroyed.\\n\\nMosiah 9:2\\n 2 Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness for\\nI would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he\\nbeing an austere and a bloodthirsty man commanded that I should\\nbe slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for\\nfather fought against father, and brother against brother, until\\nthe greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness;\\nand we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of\\nZarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.\\n\\nMosiah 9:3\\n 3 And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our\\nfathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess\\nthe land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to\\ngo up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore\\nafflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.\\n\\nMosiah 9:4\\n 4 Nevertheless, after many days' wandering in the wilderness we\\npitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain,\\nwhich was near to the land of our fathers.\\n\\nMosiah 9:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into\\nthe city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition\\nof the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my\\npeople and possess the land in peace.\\n\\nMosiah 9:6\\n 6 And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I\\nmight possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.\\n\\nMosiah 9:7\\n 7 And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the\\nland, and I and my people went into the land that we might\\npossess it.\\n\\nMosiah 9:8\\n 8 And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of\\nthe city, yea, even the walls of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the\\ncity of Shilom.\\n\\nMosiah 9:9\\n 9 And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of\\nseeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with\\nneas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and\\nwe did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.\\n\\nMosiah 9:10\\n 10 Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to\\nbring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we\\nmight possess it.\\n\\nMosiah 9:11\\n 11 Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the\\nland for the space of twelve years that king Laman began to grow\\nuneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the\\nland, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into\\nbondage.\\n\\nMosiah 9:12\\n 12 Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they\\nwere desirous to bring us into bondage, that they might glut\\nthemselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might\\nfeast themselves upon the flocks of our fields.\\n\\nMosiah 9:13\\n 13 Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up\\nhis people that they should contend with my people; therefore\\nthere began to be wars and contentions in the land.\\n\\nMosiah 9:14\\n 14 For, in the thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi,\\naway on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were\\nwatering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a\\nnumerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them,\\nand to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.\\n\\nMosiah 9:15\\n 15 Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not\\novertaken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for\\nprotection.\\n\\nMosiah 9:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with\\narrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with\\nslings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and\\nI and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.\\n\\nMosiah 9:17\\n 17 Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle\\nagainst the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to\\nthe Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our\\nenemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance\\nof our fathers.\\n\\nMosiah 9:18\\n 18 And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we\\ndid go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the\\nLamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand\\nand forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them\\nout of our land.\\n\\nMosiah 9:19\\n 19 And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their\\ndead.  And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two\\nhundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.\\n\\nMosiah 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\nMosiah 10:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that we again began to establish the\\nkingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace.  And I\\ncaused that there should be weapons of war made of every kind,\\nthat thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time\\nthe Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.\\n\\nMosiah 10:2\\n 2 And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites\\nmight not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I\\ndid guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling\\ninto the hands of our enemies.\\n\\nMosiah 10:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our\\nfathers for many years, yea, for the space of twenty and two\\nyears.\\n\\nMosiah 10:4\\n 4 And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise\\nall manner of grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.\\n\\nMosiah 10:5\\n 5 And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and\\nwork, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every\\nkind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper\\nin the land--thus we did have continual peace in the land for the\\nspace of twenty and two years.\\n\\nMosiah 10:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to\\nreign in his stead.  And he began to stir his people up in\\nrebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for\\nwar, and to come up to battle against my people.\\n\\nMosiah 10:7\\n 7 But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon,\\nthat I might discover their preparations, that I might guard\\nagainst them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy\\nthem.\\n\\nMosiah 10:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the\\nland of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows,\\nand with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with\\nstones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that\\nthey were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle\\nabout their loins.\\n\\nMosiah 10:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children\\nof my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused\\nthat all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young\\nmen that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves\\ntogether to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place\\nthem in their ranks, every man according to his age.\\n\\nMosiah 10:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the\\nLamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle\\nagainst the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that we did go up in\\nthe strength of the Lord to battle.\\n\\nMosiah 10:11\\n 11 Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the\\nstrength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own\\nstrength.  Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of\\nmen.\\n\\nMosiah 10:12\\n 12 They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people,\\nbelieving in the tradition of their fathers, which is\\nthis--Believing that they were driven out of the land of\\nJerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that\\nthey were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they\\nwere also wronged while crossing the sea;\\n\\nMosiah 10:13\\n 13 And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their\\nfirst inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this\\nbecause that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments\\nof the Lord--therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord\\nheard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of\\ntheir journey in the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 10:14\\n 14 And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood\\nnot the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon\\nthe waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 10:15\\n 15 And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in\\nthe promised land, because they said that he had taken the ruling\\nof the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.\\n\\nMosiah 10:16\\n 16 And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into\\nthe wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the\\nrecords which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said\\nthat he robbed them.\\n\\nMosiah 10:17\\n 17 And thus they have taught their children that they should\\nhate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should\\nrob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them;\\ntherefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of\\nNephi.\\n\\nMosiah 10:18\\n 18 For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying\\ncraftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have\\nbrought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy\\nthem; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.\\n\\nMosiah 10:19\\n 19 And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my\\npeople concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to\\nbattle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord;\\ntherefore, we did contend with them, face to face.\\n\\nMosiah 10:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our\\nland; and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that\\nwe did not number them.\\n\\nMosiah 10:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that we returned again to our own land,\\nand my people again began to tend their flocks, and to till their\\nground.\\n\\nMosiah 10:22\\n 22 And now I, being old, did confer the kingdom upon one of my\\nsons; therefore, I say no more.  And may the Lord bless my\\npeople.  Amen.\\n\\nMosiah 11\\nChapter 11\\n\\nMosiah 11:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon\\nNoah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his\\nstead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.\\n\\nMosiah 11:2\\n 2 For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he\\ndid walk after the desires of his own heart.  And he had many\\nwives and concubines.  And he did cause his people to commit sin,\\nand do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord.  Yea,\\nand they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.\\n\\nMosiah 11:3\\n 3 And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a\\nfifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of\\ntheir ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their\\niron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part\\nof all their grain.\\n\\nMosiah 11:4\\n 4 And all this did he take to support himself, and his wives and\\nhis concubines; and also his priests, and their wives and their\\nconcubines; thus he had changed the affairs of the kingdom.\\n\\nMosiah 11:5\\n 5 For he put down all the priests that had been consecrated by\\nhis father, and consecrated new ones in their stead, such as were\\nlifted up in the pride of their hearts.\\n\\nMosiah 11:6\\n 6 Yea, and thus they were supported in their laziness, and in\\ntheir idolatry, and in their whoredoms, by the taxes which king\\nNoah had put upon his people; thus did the people labor\\nexceedingly to support iniquity.\\n\\nMosiah 11:7\\n 7 Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were\\ndeceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and\\npriests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 11:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and\\nspacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of\\nwood, and of all manner of precious things, of gold, and of\\nsilver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;\\n\\nMosiah 11:9\\n 9 And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the\\nmidst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented\\nwith gold and silver and with precious things.\\n\\nMosiah 11:10\\n 10 And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of\\nfine work within the walls of the temple, of fine wood, and of\\ncopper, and of brass.\\n\\nMosiah 11:11\\n 11 And the seats which were set apart for the high priests,\\nwhich were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure\\ngold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that\\nthey might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they\\nshould speak lying and vain words to his people.\\n\\nMosiah 11:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that he built a tower near the temple;\\nyea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the\\ntop thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of\\nShemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even\\nlook over all the land round about.\\n\\nMosiah 11:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built\\nin the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on\\nthe hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for\\nthe children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and\\nthus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation\\nof his people.\\n\\nMosiah 11:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches,\\nand he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his\\nconcubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with\\nharlots.\\n\\nMosiah 11:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that he planted vineyards round about in\\nthe land; and he built wine-presses, and made wine in abundance;\\nand therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people.\\n\\nMosiah 11:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to come in upon\\nhis people, upon small numbers, and to slay them in their fields,\\nand while they were tending their flocks.\\n\\nMosiah 11:17\\n 17 And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them\\noff; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites\\ncame upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks\\nout of the land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them, and to\\nexercise their hatred upon them.\\n\\nMosiah 11:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies against\\nthem, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a\\ntime; therefore, they returned rejoicing in their spoil.\\n\\nMosiah 11:19\\n 19 And now, because of this great victory they were lifted up in\\nthe pride of their hearts; they did boast in their own strength,\\nsaying that their fifty could stand against thousands of the\\nLamanites; and thus they did boast, and did delight in blood, and\\nthe shedding of the blood of their brethren, and this because of\\nthe wickedness of their king and priests.\\n\\nMosiah 11:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose\\nname was Abinadi; and he went forth among them, and began to\\nprophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he\\ncommanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus\\nsaith the Lord--Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their\\nabominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and\\nexcept they repent I will visit them in mine anger.\\n\\nMosiah 11:21\\n 21 And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God,\\nbehold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea,\\nand they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be\\nafflicted by the hand of their enemies.\\n\\nMosiah 11:22\\n 22 And it shall come to pass that they shall know that I am the\\nLord their God, and am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of\\nmy people.\\n\\nMosiah 11:23\\n 23 And it shall come to pass that except this people repent and\\nturn unto the Lord their God, they shall be brought into bondage;\\nand none shall deliver them, except it be the Lord the Almighty\\nGod.\\n\\nMosiah 11:24\\n 24 Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto\\nme I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer\\nthem that they be smitten by their enemies.\\n\\nMosiah 11:25\\n 25 And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes, and cry\\nmightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear their prayers,\\nneither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus\\nsaith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.\\n\\nMosiah 11:26\\n 26 Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words\\nunto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his\\nlife; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.\\n\\nMosiah 11:27\\n 27 Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had\\nspoken unto the people, he was also wroth; and he said: Who is\\nAbinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is\\nthe Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?\\n\\nMosiah 11:28\\n 28 I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him,\\nfor he has said these things that he might stir up my people to\\nanger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people;\\ntherefore I will slay him.\\n\\nMosiah 11:29\\n 29 Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they\\nhardened their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they\\nsought from that time forward to take him.  And king Noah\\nhardened his heart against the word of the Lord, and he did not\\nrepent of his evil doings.\\n\\nMosiah 12\\nChapter 12\\n\\nMosiah 12:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that after the space of two years that\\nAbinadi came among them in disguise, that they knew him not, and\\nbegan to prophesy among them, saying: Thus has the Lord commanded\\nme, saying--Abinadi, go and prophesy unto this my people, for\\nthey have hardened their hearts against my words; they have\\nrepented not of their evil doings; therefore, I will visit them\\nin my anger, yea, in my fierce anger will I visit them in their\\niniquities and abominations.\\n\\nMosiah 12:2\\n 2 Yea, wo be unto this generation!  And the Lord said unto me:\\nStretch forth thy hand and prophesy saying: Thus saith the Lord,\\nit shall come to pass that this generation, because of their\\niniquities, shall be brought into bondage, and shall be smitten\\non the cheek; yea, and shall be driven by men, and shall be\\nslain; and the vultures of the air, and the dogs, yea, and the\\nwild beasts, shall devour their flesh.\\n\\nMosiah 12:3\\n 3 And it shall come to pass that the life of king Noah shall be\\nvalued even as a garment in a hot furnace; for he shall know that\\nI am the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 12:4\\n 4 And it shall come to pass that I will smite this my people\\nwith sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with pestilence; and\\nI will cause that they shall howl all the day long.\\n\\nMosiah 12:5\\n 5 Yea, and I will cause that they shall have burdens lashed upon\\ntheir backs; and they shall be driven before like a dumb ass.\\n\\nMosiah 12:6\\n 6 And it shall come to pass that I will send forth hail among\\nthem, and it shall smite them; and they shall also be smitten\\nwith the east wind; and insects shall pester their land also, and\\ndevour their grain.\\n\\nMosiah 12:7\\n 7 And they shall be smitten with a great pestilence--and all\\nthis will I do because of their iniquities and abominations.\\n\\nMosiah 12:8\\n 8 And it shall come to pass that except they repent I will\\nutterly destroy them from off the face of the earth; yet they\\nshall leave a record behind them, and I will preserve them for\\nother nations which shall possess the land; yea, even this will I\\ndo that I may discover the abominations of this people to other\\nnations.  And many things did Abinadi prophesy against this\\npeople.\\n\\nMosiah 12:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they were angry with him; and they\\ntook him and carried him bound before the king, and said unto the\\nking: Behold, we have brought a man before thee who has\\nprophesied evil concerning thy people, and saith that God will\\ndestroy them.\\n\\nMosiah 12:10\\n 10 And he also prophesieth evil concerning thy life, and saith\\nthat thy life shall be as a garment in a furnace of fire.\\n\\nMosiah 12:11\\n 11 And again, he saith that thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a\\ndry stalk of the field, which is run over by the beasts and\\ntrodden under foot.\\n\\nMosiah 12:12\\n 12 And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a\\nthistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is\\ndriven forth upon the face of the land.  And he pretendeth the\\nLord hath spoken it.  And he saith all this shall come upon thee\\nexcept thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.\\n\\nMosiah 12:13\\n 13 And now, O king, what great evil hast thou done, or what\\ngreat sins have thy people committed, that we should be condemned\\nof God or judged of this man?\\n\\nMosiah 12:14\\n 14 And now, O king, behold, we are guiltless, and thou, O king,\\nhast not sinned; therefore, this man has lied concerning you, and\\nhe has prophesied in vain.\\n\\nMosiah 12:15\\n 15 And behold, we are strong, we shall not come into bondage, or\\nbe taken captive by our enemies; yea, and thou hast prospered in\\nthe land, and thou shalt also prosper.\\n\\nMosiah 12:16\\n 16 Behold, here is the man, we deliver him into thy hands; thou\\nmayest do with him as seemeth thee good.\\n\\nMosiah 12:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that king Noah caused that Abinadi should\\nbe cast into prison; and he commanded that the priests should\\ngather themselves together that he might hold a council with them\\nwhat he should do with him.\\n\\nMosiah 12:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that they said unto the king: Bring him\\nhither that we may question him; and the king commanded that he\\nshould be brought before them.\\n\\nMosiah 12:19\\n 19 And they began to question him, that they might cross him,\\nthat thereby they might have wherewith to accuse him; but he\\nanswered them boldly, and withstood all their questions, yea, to\\ntheir astonishment; for he did withstand them in all their\\nquestions, and did confound them in all their words.\\n\\nMosiah 12:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What\\nmeaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught\\nby our fathers, saying:\\n\\nMosiah 12:21\\n 21 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that\\nbringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good\\ntidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion,\\nThy God reigneth;\\n\\nMosiah 12:22\\n 22 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together\\nshall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord\\nshall bring again Zion;\\n\\nMosiah 12:23\\n 23 Break forth into joy; sing together ye waste places of\\nJerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath\\nredeemed Jerusalem;\\n\\nMosiah 12:24\\n 24 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the\\nnations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of\\nour God?\\n\\nMosiah 12:25\\n 25 And now Abinadi said unto them: Are you priests, and pretend\\nto teach this people, and to understand the spirit of\\nprophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean?\\n\\nMosiah 12:26\\n 26 I say unto you, wo be unto you for perverting the ways of the\\nLord!  For if ye understand these things ye have not taught them;\\ntherefore, ye have perverted the ways of the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 12:27\\n 27 Ye have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore,\\nye have not been wise.  Therefore, what teach ye this people?\\n\\nMosiah 12:28\\n 28 And they said: We teach the law of Moses.\\n\\nMosiah 12:29\\n 29 And again he said unto them: If ye teach the law of Moses why\\ndo ye not keep it?  Why do ye set your hearts upon riches?  Why\\ndo ye commit whoredoms and spend your strength with harlots, yea,\\nand cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord has cause to\\nsend me to prophesy against this people, yea, even a great evil\\nagainst this people?\\n\\nMosiah 12:30\\n 30 Know ye not that I speak the truth?  Yea, ye know that I\\nspeak the truth; and you ought to tremble before God.\\n\\nMosiah 12:31\\n 31 And it shall come to pass that ye shall be smitten for your\\niniquities, for ye have said that ye teach the law of Moses.  And\\nwhat know ye concerning the law of Moses?  Doth salvation come by\\nthe law of Moses?  What say ye?\\n\\nMosiah 12:32\\n 32 And they answered and said that salvation did come by the law\\nof Moses.\\n\\nMosiah 12:33\\n 33 But now Abinadi said unto them: I know if ye keep the\\ncommandments of God ye shall be saved; yea, if ye keep the\\ncommandments which the Lord delivered unto Moses in the mount of\\nSinai, saying:\\n\\nMosiah 12:34\\n 34 I am the Lord thy God, who hath brought thee out of the land\\nof Egypt, out of the house of bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 12:35\\n 35 Thou shalt have no other God before me.\\n\\nMosiah 12:36\\n 36 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any\\nlikeness of any thing in heaven above, or things which are in the\\nearth beneath.\\n\\nMosiah 12:37\\n 37 Now Abinadi said unto them, Have ye done all this?  I say\\nunto you, Nay, ye have not.  And have ye taught this people that\\nthey should do all these things?  I say unto you, Nay, ye have\\nnot.\\n\\nMosiah 13\\nChapter 13\\n\\nMosiah 13:1\\n 1 And now when the king had heard these words, he said unto his\\npriests: Away with this fellow, and slay him; for what have we to\\ndo with him, for he is mad.\\n\\nMosiah 13:2\\n 2 And they stood forth and attempted to lay their hands on him;\\nbut he withstood them, and said unto them:\\n\\nMosiah 13:3\\n 3 Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands\\nupon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent\\nme to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested\\nthat I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall\\nbe destroyed at this time.\\n\\nMosiah 13:4\\n 4 But I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God has commanded\\nme; and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me. \\nAnd again, because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged\\nme that I am mad.\\n\\nMosiah 13:5\\n 5 Now it came to pass after Abinadi had spoken these words that\\nthe people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on him, for the\\nSpirit of the Lord was upon him; and his face shone with\\nexceeding luster, even as Moses' did while in the mount of Sinai,\\nwhile speaking with the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 13:6\\n 6 And he spake with power and authority from God; and he\\ncontinued his words, saying:\\n\\nMosiah 13:7\\n 7 Ye see that ye have not power to slay me, therefore I finish\\nmy message.  Yea, and I perceive that it cuts you to your hearts\\nbecause I tell you the truth concerning your iniquities.\\n\\nMosiah 13:8\\n 8 Yea, and my words fill you with wonder and amazement, and with\\nanger.\\n\\nMosiah 13:9\\n 9 But I finish my message; and then it matters not whither I go,\\nif it so be that I am saved.\\n\\nMosiah 13:10\\n 10 But this much I tell you, what you do with me, after this,\\nshall be as a type and a shadow of things which are to come.\\n\\nMosiah 13:11\\n 11 And now I read unto you the remainder of the commandments of\\nGod, for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts; I\\nperceive that ye have studied and taught iniquity the most part\\nof your lives.\\n\\nMosiah 13:12\\n 12 And now, ye remember that I said unto you: Thou shall not\\nmake unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of things which\\nare in heaven above, or which are in the earth beneath, or which\\nare in the water under the earth.\\n\\nMosiah 13:13\\n 13 And again: Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor\\nserve them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the\\niniquities of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and\\nfourth generations of them that hate me;\\n\\nMosiah 13:14\\n 14 And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and\\nkeep my commandments.\\n\\nMosiah 13:15\\n 15 Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for\\nthe Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in\\nvain.\\n\\nMosiah 13:16\\n 16 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\\n\\nMosiah 13:17\\n 17 Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;\\n\\nMosiah 13:18\\n 18 But the seventh day, the sabbath of the Lord thy God, thou\\nshalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy\\nman-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy\\nstranger that is within thy gates;\\n\\nMosiah 13:19\\n 19 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea,\\nand all that in them is; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath\\nday, and hallowed it.\\n\\nMosiah 13:20\\n 20 Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long\\nupon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\\n\\nMosiah 13:21\\n 21 Thou shalt not kill.\\n\\nMosiah 13:22\\n 22 Thou shalt not commit adultery.  Thou shalt not steal.\\n\\nMosiah 13:23\\n 23 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\\n\\nMosiah 13:24\\n 24 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not\\ncovet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his\\nmaid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy\\nneighbor's.\\n\\nMosiah 13:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that after Abinadi had made an end of\\nthese sayings that he said unto them: Have ye taught this people\\nthat they should observe to do all these things for to keep these\\ncommandments?\\n\\nMosiah 13:26\\n 26 I say unto you, Nay; for if ye had, the Lord would not have\\ncaused me to come forth and to prophesy evil concerning this\\npeople.\\n\\nMosiah 13:27\\n 27 And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of\\nMoses.  I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep\\nthe law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall\\ncome when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.\\n\\nMosiah 13:28\\n 28 And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by\\nthe law alone; and were it not for the atonement, which God\\nhimself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people,\\nthat they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of\\nMoses.\\n\\nMosiah 13:29\\n 29 And now I say unto you that it was expedient that there\\nshould be a law given to the children of Israel, yea, even a very\\nstrict law; for they were a stiffnecked people, quick to do\\niniquity, and slow to remember the Lord their God;\\n\\nMosiah 13:30\\n 30 Therefore there was a law given them, yea, a law of\\nperformances and of ordinances, a law which they were to observe\\nstrictly from day to day, to keep them in remembrance of God and\\ntheir duty towards him.\\n\\nMosiah 13:31\\n 31 But behold, I say unto you, that all these things were types\\nof things to come.\\n\\nMosiah 13:32\\n 32 And now, did they understand the law?  I say unto you, Nay,\\nthey did not all understand the law; and this because of the\\nhardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there\\ncould not any man be saved except it were through the redemption\\nof God.\\n\\nMosiah 13:33\\n 33 For behold, did not Moses prophesy unto them concerning the\\ncoming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people? \\nYea, and even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the\\nworld began--have they not spoken more or less concerning these\\nthings?\\n\\nMosiah 13:34\\n 34 Have they not said that God himself should come down among\\nthe children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go\\nforth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?\\n\\nMosiah 13:35\\n 35 Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass\\nthe resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should be\\noppressed and afflicted?\\n\\nMosiah 14\\nChapter 14\\n\\nMosiah 14:1\\n 1 Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed our report,\\nand to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?\\n\\nMosiah 14:2\\n 2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a\\nroot out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when\\nwe shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.\\n\\nMosiah 14:3\\n 3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and\\nacquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him;\\nhe was despised, and we esteemed him not.\\n\\nMosiah 14:4\\n 4 Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet\\nwe did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.\\n\\nMosiah 14:5\\n 5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\\nour iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and\\nwith his stripes we are healed.\\n\\nMosiah 14:6\\n 6 All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one\\nto his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of\\nus all.\\n\\nMosiah 14:7\\n 7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his\\nmouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep\\nbefore her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth.\\n\\nMosiah 14:8\\n 8 He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall\\ndeclare his generation?  For he was cut off out of the land of\\nthe living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.\\n\\nMosiah 14:9\\n 9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in\\nhis death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in\\nhis mouth.\\n\\nMosiah 14:10\\n 10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to\\ngrief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall\\nsee his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the\\nLord shall prosper in his hand.\\n\\nMosiah 14:11\\n 11 He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied;\\nby his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he\\nshall bear their iniquities.\\n\\nMosiah 14:12\\n 12 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he\\nshall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured\\nout his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the\\ntransgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made\\nintercession for the transgressors.\\n\\nMosiah 15\\nChapter 15\\n\\nMosiah 15:1\\n 1 And now Abinadi said unto them: I would that ye should\\nunderstand that God himself shall come down among the children of\\nmen, and shall redeem his people.\\n\\nMosiah 15:2\\n 2 And because he dwelleth in flesh he shall be called the Son of\\nGod, and having subjected the flesh to the will of the Father,\\nbeing the Father and the Son--\\n\\nMosiah 15:3\\n 3 The Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and\\nthe Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son--\\n\\nMosiah 15:4\\n 4 And they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven\\nand of earth.\\n\\nMosiah 15:5\\n 5 And thus the flesh becoming subject to the Spirit, or the Son\\nto the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth\\nnot to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and\\nscourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people.\\n\\nMosiah 15:6\\n 6 And after all this, after working many mighty miracles among\\nthe children of men, he shall be led, yea, even as Isaiah said,\\nas a sheep before the shearer is dumb, so he opened not his\\nmouth.\\n\\nMosiah 15:7\\n 7 Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh\\nbecoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being\\nswallowed up in the will of the Father.\\n\\nMosiah 15:8\\n 8 And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the\\nvictory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for\\nthe children of men--\\n\\nMosiah 15:9\\n 9 Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being\\nfilled with compassion towards the children of men; standing\\nbetwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken\\nupon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having\\nredeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.\\n\\nMosiah 15:10\\n 10 And now I say unto you, who shall declare his generation? \\nBehold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an\\noffering for sin he shall see his seed.  And now what say ye? \\nAnd who shall be his seed?\\n\\nMosiah 15:11\\n 11 Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of\\nthe prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied\\nconcerning the coming of the Lord--I say unto you, that all those\\nwho have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord\\nwould redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for\\na remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his\\nseed, or they are heirs of the kingdom of God.\\n\\nMosiah 15:12\\n 12 For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they\\nfor whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions. \\nAnd now, are they not his seed?\\n\\nMosiah 15:13\\n 13 Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his\\nmouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean\\nall the holy prophets ever since the world began?  I say unto you\\nthat they are his seed.\\n\\nMosiah 15:14\\n 14 And these are they who have published peace, who have brought\\ngood tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto\\nZion: Thy God reigneth!\\n\\nMosiah 15:15\\n 15 And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!\\n\\nMosiah 15:16\\n 16 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of\\nthose that are still publishing peace!\\n\\nMosiah 15:17\\n 17 And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of\\nthose who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time\\nhenceforth and forever!\\n\\nMosiah 15:18\\n 18 And behold, I say unto you, this is not all.  For O how\\nbeautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth\\ngood tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord,\\nwho has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation\\nunto his people;\\n\\nMosiah 15:19\\n 19 For were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his\\npeople, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, I\\nsay unto you, were it not for this, all mankind must have\\nperished.\\n\\nMosiah 15:20\\n 20 But behold, the bands of death shall be broken, and the Son\\nreigneth, and hath power over the dead; therefore, he bringeth to\\npass the resurrection of the dead.\\n\\nMosiah 15:21\\n 21 And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection;\\nyea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are,\\nand who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ--for so\\nshall he be called.\\n\\nMosiah 15:22\\n 22 And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those\\nthat have believed in their words, or all those that have kept\\nthe commandments of God, shall come forth in the first\\nresurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.\\n\\nMosiah 15:23\\n 23 They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus\\nthey have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands\\nof death.\\n\\nMosiah 15:24\\n 24 And these are those who have part in the first resurrection;\\nand these are they that have died before Christ came, in their\\nignorance, not having salvation declared unto them.  And thus the\\nLord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a\\npart in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being\\nredeemed by the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 15:25\\n 25 And little children also have eternal life.\\n\\nMosiah 15:26\\n 26 But behold, and fear, and tremble before God, for ye ought to\\ntremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him\\nand die in their sins; yea, even all those that have perished in\\ntheir sins ever since the world began, that have wilfully\\nrebelled against God, that have known the commandments of God,\\nand would not keep them; these are they that have no part in the\\nfirst resurrection.\\n\\nMosiah 15:27\\n 27 Therefore ought ye not to tremble?  For salvation cometh to\\nnone such; for the Lord hath redeemed none such; yea, neither can\\nthe Lord redeem such; for he cannot deny himself; for he cannot\\ndeny justice when it has its claim.\\n\\nMosiah 15:28\\n 28 And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the\\nsalvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred,\\ntongue, and people.\\n\\nMosiah 15:29\\n 29 Yea, Lord, thy watchmen shall lift up their voice; with the\\nvoice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye,\\nwhen the Lord shall bring again Zion.\\n\\nMosiah 15:30\\n 30 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of\\nJerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath\\nredeemed Jerusalem.\\n\\nMosiah 15:31\\n 31 The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the\\nnations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of\\nour God.\\n\\nMosiah 16\\nChapter 16\\n\\nMosiah 16:1\\n 1 And now, it came to pass that after Abinadi had spoken these\\nwords he stretched forth his hand and said: The time shall come\\nwhen all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation,\\nkindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall\\nconfess before God that his judgments are just.\\n\\nMosiah 16:2\\n 2 And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have\\ncause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and\\nthis because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord;\\ntherefore the Lord redeemeth them not.\\n\\nMosiah 16:3\\n 3 For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over\\nthem; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first\\nparents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause\\nof all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil\\nfrom good, subjecting themselves to the devil.\\n\\nMosiah 16:4\\n 4 Thus all mankind were lost; and behold, they would have been\\nendlessly lost were it not that God redeemed his people from\\ntheir lost and fallen state.\\n\\nMosiah 16:5\\n 5 But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature,\\nand goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God,\\nremaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over\\nhim.  Therefore, he is as though there was no redemption made,\\nbeing an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.\\n\\nMosiah 16:6\\n 6 And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of\\nthings to come as though they had already come, there could have\\nbeen no redemption.\\n\\nMosiah 16:7\\n 7 And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the\\nbands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that\\ndeath should have no sting, there could have been no\\nresurrection.\\n\\nMosiah 16:8\\n 8 But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no\\nvictory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.\\n\\nMosiah 16:9\\n 9 He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that\\nis endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life\\nwhich is endless, that there can be no more death.\\n\\nMosiah 16:10\\n 10 Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this\\ncorruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to\\nstand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to\\ntheir works whether they be good or whether they be evil--\\n\\nMosiah 16:11\\n 11 If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and\\nhappiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless\\ndamnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected\\nthem, which is damnation--\\n\\nMosiah 16:12\\n 12 Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires;\\nhaving never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were\\nextended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended\\ntowards them, and they would not; they being warned of their\\niniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were\\ncommanded to repent and yet they would not repent.\\n\\nMosiah 16:13\\n 13 And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and\\nremember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?\\n\\nMosiah 16:14\\n 14 Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also teach that it\\nis a shadow of those things which are to come--\\n\\nMosiah 16:15\\n 15 Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord,\\nwho is the very Eternal Father.  Amen.\\n\\nMosiah 17\\nChapter 17\\n\\nMosiah 17:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Abinadi had finished these\\nsayings, that the king commanded that the priests should take him\\nand cause that he should be put to death.\\n\\nMosiah 17:2\\n 2 But there was one among them whose name was Alma, he also\\nbeing a descendant of Nephi.  And he was a young man, and he\\nbelieved the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew\\nconcerning the iniquity which Abinadi has testified against them;\\ntherefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be\\nangry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.\\n\\nMosiah 17:3\\n 3 But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be\\ncast out from among them, and sent his servants after him that\\nthey might slay him.\\n\\nMosiah 17:4\\n 4 But he fled from before them and hid himself that they found\\nhim not.  And he being concealed for many days did write all the\\nwords which Abinadi had spoken.\\n\\nMosiah 17:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards\\nshould surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and cast\\nhim into prison.\\n\\nMosiah 17:6\\n 6 And after three days, having counseled with his priests, he\\ncaused that he should again be brought before him.\\n\\nMosiah 17:7\\n 7 And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation\\nagainst thee, and thou art worthy of death.\\n\\nMosiah 17:8\\n 8 For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the\\nchildren of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to\\ndeath unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast\\nspoken evil concerning me and my people.\\n\\nMosiah 17:9\\n 9 Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will not recall\\nthe words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people,\\nfor they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have\\nsuffered myself that I have fallen into your hands.\\n\\nMosiah 17:10\\n 10 Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not\\nrecall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you.\\n\\nAnd if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall\\nalso stand as a testimony against you at the last day.\\n\\nMosiah 17:11\\n 11 And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his\\nword; for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon\\nhim.\\n\\nMosiah 17:12\\n 12 But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began\\nto accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king.  Therefore the\\nking was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him up\\nthat he might be slain.\\n\\nMosiah 17:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and\\nscourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death.\\n\\nMosiah 17:14\\n 14 And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto\\nthem, saying:\\n\\nMosiah 17:15\\n 15 Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to\\npass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains\\nthat I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this\\nbecause they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.\\n\\nMosiah 17:16\\n 16 And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all\\nmanner of diseases because of your iniquities.\\n\\nMosiah 17:17\\n 17 Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be\\ndriven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven\\nby wild and ferocious beasts.\\n\\nMosiah 17:18\\n 18 And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by\\nthe hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer,\\nthe pains of death by fire.\\n\\nMosiah 17:19\\n 19 Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his\\npeople.  O God, receive my soul.\\n\\nMosiah 17:20\\n 20 And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having\\nsuffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he\\nwould not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth\\nof his words by his death.\\n\\nMosiah 18\\nChapter 18\\n\\nMosiah 18:1\\n 1 And now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the\\nservants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and\\nwent about privately among the people, and began to teach the\\nwords of Abinadi--\\n\\nMosiah 18:2\\n 2 Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning\\nthe resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people,\\nwhich was to be brought to pass through the power, and\\nsufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and\\nascension into heaven.\\n\\nMosiah 18:3\\n 3 And as many as would hear his word he did teach.  And he\\ntaught them privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of\\nthe king.  And many did believe his words.\\n\\nMosiah 18:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go\\nforth to a place which was called Mormon, having received its\\nname from the king, being in the borders of the land having been\\ninfested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.\\n\\nMosiah 18:5\\n 5 Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma\\nresorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small\\ntrees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches\\nof the king.\\n\\nMosiah 18:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither\\nto hear his words.\\n\\nMosiah 18:7\\n 7 And it came to pass after many days there were a goodly number\\ngathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of\\nAlma.  Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word,\\nto hear him.  And he did teach them, and did preach unto them\\nrepentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 18:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are\\nthe waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye\\nare desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his\\npeople, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they\\nmay be light;\\n\\nMosiah 18:9\\n 9 Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and\\ncomfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as\\nwitnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all\\nplaces that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be\\nredeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first\\nresurrection, that ye may have eternal life--\\n\\nMosiah 18:10\\n 10 Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts,\\nwhat have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as\\na witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with\\nhim, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he\\nmay pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?\\n\\nMosiah 18:11\\n 11 And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped\\ntheir hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our\\nhearts.\\n\\nMosiah 18:12\\n 12 And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of\\nthe first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried,\\nsaying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may\\ndo this work with holiness of heart.\\n\\nMosiah 18:13\\n 13 And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was\\nupon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority\\nfrom the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a\\ncovenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body;\\nand may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he\\ngrant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ,\\nwhom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.\\n\\nMosiah 18:14\\n 14 And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were\\nburied in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the\\nwater rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.\\n\\nMosiah 18:15\\n 15 And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time\\ninto the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he\\ndid not bury himself again in the water.\\n\\nMosiah 18:16\\n 16 And after this manner he did baptize every one that went\\nforth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two\\nhundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters\\nof Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.\\n\\nMosiah 18:17\\n 17 And they were called the church of God, or the church of\\nChrist, from that time forward.  And it came to pass that\\nwhosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was\\nadded to his church.\\n\\nMosiah 18:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God,\\nordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number\\ndid he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning\\nthe things pertaining to the kingdom of God.\\n\\nMosiah 18:19\\n 19 And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it\\nwere the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by\\nthe mouth of the holy prophets.\\n\\nMosiah 18:20\\n 20 Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing\\nsave it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed\\nhis people.\\n\\nMosiah 18:21\\n 21 And he commanded them that there should be no contention one\\nwith another, but that they should look forward with one eye,\\nhaving one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit\\ntogether in unity and in love one towards another.\\n\\nMosiah 18:22\\n 22 And thus he commanded them to preach.  And thus they became\\nthe children of God.\\n\\nMosiah 18:23\\n 23 And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath\\nday, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks\\nto the Lord their God.\\n\\nMosiah 18:24\\n 24 And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had\\nordained should labor with their own hands for their support.\\n\\nMosiah 18:25\\n 25 And there was one day in every week that was set apart that\\nthey should gather themselves together to teach the people, and\\nto worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in\\ntheir power, to assemble themselves together.\\n\\nMosiah 18:26\\n 26 And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their\\nsupport; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of\\nGod, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the\\nknowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority\\nfrom God.\\n\\nMosiah 18:27\\n 27 And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should\\nimpart of their substance, every one according to that which he\\nhad; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly;\\nand of him that had but little, but little should be required;\\nand to him that had not should be given.\\n\\nMosiah 18:28\\n 28 And thus they should impart of their substance of their own\\nfree will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that\\nstood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.\\n\\nMosiah 18:29\\n 29 And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and\\nthey did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both\\ntemporally and spiritually according to their needs and their\\nwants.\\n\\nMosiah 18:30\\n 30 And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon,\\nyea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the\\nwaters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon,\\nthe forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them\\nwho there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how\\nblessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.\\n\\nMosiah 18:31\\n 31 And these things were done in the borders of the land, that\\nthey might not come to the knowledge of the king.\\n\\nMosiah 18:32\\n 32 But behold, it came to pass that the king, having discovered\\na movement among the people, sent his servants to watch them. \\nTherefore on the day that they were assembling themselves\\ntogether to hear the word of the Lord they were discovered unto\\nthe king.\\n\\nMosiah 18:33\\n 33 And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the people to\\nrebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy\\nthem.\\n\\nMosiah 18:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that Alma and the people of the Lord were\\napprised of the coming of the king's army; therefore they took\\ntheir tents and their families and departed into the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 18:35\\n 35 And they were in number about four hundred and fifty souls.\\n\\nMosiah 19\\nChapter 19\\n\\nMosiah 19:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the army of the king returned, having\\nsearched in vain for the people of the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 19:2\\n 2 And now behold, the forces of the king were small, having been\\nreduced, and there began to be a division among the remainder of\\nthe people.\\n\\nMosiah 19:3\\n 3 And the lesser part began to breathe out threatenings against\\nthe king, and there began to be a great contention among them.\\n\\nMosiah 19:4\\n 4 And now there was a man among them whose name was Gideon, and\\nhe being a strong man and an enemy to the king, therefore he drew\\nhis sword, and swore in his wrath that he would slay the king.\\n\\nMosiah 19:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the\\nking saw that he was about to overpower him, he fled and ran and\\ngot upon the tower which was near the temple.\\n\\nMosiah 19:6\\n 6 And Gideon pursued after him and was about to get upon the\\ntower to slay the king, and the king cast his eyes round about\\ntowards the land of Shemlon, and behold, the army of the\\nLamanites were within the borders of the land.\\n\\nMosiah 19:7\\n 7 And now the king cried out in the anguish of his soul, saying:\\nGideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon us, and they will\\ndestroy us; yea, they will destroy my people.\\n\\nMosiah 19:8\\n 8 And now the king was not so much concerned about his people as\\nhe was about his own life; nevertheless, Gideon did spare his\\nlife.\\n\\nMosiah 19:9\\n 9 And the king commanded the people that they should flee before\\nthe Lamanites, and he himself did go before them, and they did\\nflee into the wilderness, with their women and their children.\\n\\nMosiah 19:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue them, and\\ndid overtake them, and began to slay them.\\n\\nMosiah 19:11\\n 11 Now it came to pass that the king commanded them that all the\\nmen should leave their wives and their children, and flee before\\nthe Lamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 19:12\\n 12 Now there were many that would not leave them, but had rather\\nstay and perish with them.  And the rest left their wives and\\ntheir children and fled.\\n\\nMosiah 19:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that those who tarried with their wives\\nand their children caused that their fair daughters should stand\\nforth and plead with the Lamanites that they would not slay them.\\n\\nMosiah 19:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on\\nthem, for they were charmed with the beauty of their women.\\n\\nMosiah 19:15\\n 15 Therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives, and took them\\ncaptives and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted\\nunto them that they might possess the land, under the conditions\\nthat they would deliver up king Noah into the hands of the\\nLamanites, and deliver up their property, even one half of all\\nthey possessed, one half of their gold, and their silver, and all\\ntheir precious things, and thus they should pay tribute to the\\nking of the Lamanites from year to year.\\n\\nMosiah 19:16\\n 16 And now there was one of the sons of the king among those\\nthat were taken captive, whose name was Limhi.\\n\\nMosiah 19:17\\n 17 And now Limhi was desirous that his father should not be\\ndestroyed; nevertheless, Limhi was not ignorant of the iniquities\\nof his father, he himself being a just man.\\n\\nMosiah 19:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Gideon sent men into the wilderness\\nsecretly, to search for the king and those that were with him. \\nAnd it came to pass that they met the people in the wilderness,\\nall save the king and his priests.\\n\\nMosiah 19:19\\n 19 Now they had sworn in their hearts that they would return to\\nthe land of Nephi, and if their wives and their children were\\nslain, and also those that had tarried with them, that they would\\nseek revenge, and also perish with them.\\n\\nMosiah 19:20\\n 20 And the king commanded them that they should not return; and\\nthey were angry with the king, and caused that he should suffer,\\neven unto death by fire.\\n\\nMosiah 19:21\\n 21 And they were about to take the priests also and put them to\\ndeath, and they fled before them.\\n\\nMosiah 19:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that they were about to return to the\\nland of Nephi, and they met the men of Gideon.  And the men of\\nGideon told them of all that had happened to their wives and\\ntheir children; and that the Lamanites had granted unto them that\\nthey might possess the land by paying a tribute to the Lamanites\\nof one half of all they possessed.\\n\\nMosiah 19:23\\n 23 And the people told the men of Gideon that they had slain the\\nking, and his priests had fled from them farther into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 19:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that after they had ended the ceremony,\\nthat they returned to the land of Nephi, rejoicing, because their\\nwives and their children were not slain; and they told Gideon\\nwhat they had done to the king.\\n\\nMosiah 19:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites made an\\noath unto them, that his people should not slay them.\\n\\nMosiah 19:26\\n 26 And also Limhi, being the son of the king, having the kingdom\\nconferred upon him by the people, made oath unto the king of the\\nLamanites that his people should pay tribute unto him, even one\\nhalf of all they possessed.\\n\\nMosiah 19:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that Limhi began to establish the kingdom\\nand to establish peace among his people.\\n\\nMosiah 19:28\\n 28 And the king of the Lamanites set guards round about the\\nland, that he might keep the people of Limhi in the land, that\\nthey might not depart into the wilderness; and he did support his\\nguards out of the tribute which he did receive from the Nephites.\\n\\nMosiah 19:29\\n 29 And now king Limhi did have continual peace in his kingdom\\nfor the space of two years, that the Lamanites did not molest\\nthem nor seek to destroy them.\\n\\nMosiah 20\\nChapter 20\\n\\nMosiah 20:1\\n 1 Now there was a place in Shemlon where the daughters of the\\nLamanites did gather themselves together to sing, and to dance,\\nand to make themselves merry.\\n\\nMosiah 20:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that there was one day a small number of\\nthem gathered together to sing and to dance.\\n\\nMosiah 20:3\\n 3 And now the priests of king Noah, being ashamed to return to\\nthe city of Nephi, yea, and also fearing that the people would\\nslay them, therefore they durst not return to their wives and\\ntheir children.\\n\\nMosiah 20:4\\n 4 And having tarried in the wilderness, and having discovered\\nthe daughters of the Lamanites, they laid and watched them;\\n\\nMosiah 20:5\\n 5 And when there were but few of them gathered together to\\ndance, they came forth out of their secret places and took them\\nand carried them into the wilderness; yea, twenty and four of the\\ndaughters of the Lamanites they carried into the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 20:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that their\\ndaughters had been missing, they were angry with the people of\\nLimhi, for they thought it was the people of Limhi.\\n\\nMosiah 20:7\\n 7 Therefore they sent their armies forth; yea, even the king\\nhimself went before his people; and they went up to the land of\\nNephi to destroy the people of Limhi.\\n\\nMosiah 20:8\\n 8 And now Limhi had discovered them from the tower, even all\\ntheir preparations for war did he discover; therefore he gathered\\nhis people together, and laid wait for them in the fields and in\\nthe forests.\\n\\nMosiah 20:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had come up, that\\nthe people of Limhi began to fall upon them from their waiting\\nplaces, and began to slay them.\\n\\nMosiah 20:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the battle became exceedingly sore,\\nfor they fought like lions for their prey.\\n\\nMosiah 20:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive\\nthe Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as\\nthe Lamanites.  But they fought for their lives, and for their\\nwives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves\\nand like dragons did they fight.\\n\\nMosiah 20:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites\\namong the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been\\nwounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his\\npeople.\\n\\nMosiah 20:13\\n 13 And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him\\nbefore Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the\\nLamanites; he having received a wound has fallen among their\\ndead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him\\nbefore you; and now let us slay him.\\n\\nMosiah 20:14\\n 14 But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring\\nhim hither that I may see him.  And they brought him.  And Limhi\\nsaid unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my\\npeople?  Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made\\nunto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made\\nunto my people?\\n\\nMosiah 20:15\\n 15 And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy\\npeople did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in\\nmy anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy\\npeople.\\n\\nMosiah 20:16\\n 16 And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter;\\ntherefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever\\nhas done this thing shall perish.  Therefore he caused a search\\nto be made among his people.\\n\\nMosiah 20:17\\n 17 Now when Gideon had heard these things, he being the king's\\ncaptain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee\\nforbear, and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to\\ntheir charge.\\n\\nMosiah 20:18\\n 18 For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this\\npeople sought to destroy?  And are they not in the wilderness? \\nAnd are not they the ones who have stolen the daughters of the\\nLamanites?\\n\\nMosiah 20:19\\n 19 And now, behold, and tell the king of these things, that he\\nmay tell his people that they may be pacified towards us; for\\nbehold they are already preparing to come against us; and behold\\nalso there are but few of us.\\n\\nMosiah 20:20\\n 20 And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and except\\nthe king doth pacify them towards us we must perish.\\n\\nMosiah 20:21\\n 21 For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled, which he\\nprophesied against us--and all this because we would not hearken\\nunto the words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities?\\n\\nMosiah 20:22\\n 22 And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the oath which\\nwe have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in\\nbondage than that we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put\\na stop to the shedding of so much blood.\\n\\nMosiah 20:23\\n 23 And now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his\\nfather, and the priests that had fled into the wilderness, and\\nattributed the carrying away of their daughters to them.\\n\\nMosiah 20:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that the king was pacified towards his\\npeople; and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people,\\nwithout arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my people\\nshall not slay thy people.\\n\\nMosiah 20:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went\\nforth without arms to meet the Lamanites.  And it came to pass\\nthat they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites\\ndid bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the\\npeople of Limhi.\\n\\nMosiah 20:26\\n 26 And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they\\nwere without arms, they had compassion on them and were pacified\\ntowards them, and returned with their king in peace to their own\\nland.\\n\\nMosiah 21\\nChapter 21\\n\\nMosiah 21:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that Limhi and his people returned to the\\ncity of Nephi, and began to dwell in the land again in peace.\\n\\nMosiah 21:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that after many days the Lamanites began\\nagain to be stirred up in anger against the Nephites, and they\\nbegan to come into the borders of the land round about.\\n\\nMosiah 21:3\\n 3 Now they durst not slay them, because of the oath which their\\nking had made unto Limhi; but they would smite them on their\\ncheeks, and exercise authority over them; and began to put heavy\\nburdens upon their backs, and drive them as they would a dumb\\nass--\\n\\nMosiah 21:4\\n 4 Yea, all this was done that the word of the Lord might be\\nfulfilled.\\n\\nMosiah 21:5\\n 5 And now the afflictions of the Nephites were great, and there\\nwas no way that they could deliver themselves out of their hands,\\nfor the Lamanites had surrounded them on every side.\\n\\nMosiah 21:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that the people began to murmur with the\\nking because of their afflictions; and they began to be desirous\\nto go against them to battle.  And they did afflict the king\\nsorely with their complaints; therefore he granted unto them that\\nthey should do according to their desires.\\n\\nMosiah 21:7\\n 7 And they gathered themselves together again, and put on their\\narmor, and went forth against the Lamanites to drive them out of\\ntheir land.\\n\\nMosiah 21:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did beat them, and\\ndrove them back, and slew many of them.\\n\\nMosiah 21:9\\n 9 And now there was a great mourning and lamentation among the\\npeople of Limhi, the widow mourning for her husband, the son and\\nthe daughter mourning for their father, and the brothers for\\ntheir brethren.\\n\\nMosiah 21:10\\n 10 Now there were a great many widows in the land, and they did\\ncry mightily from day to day, for a great fear of the Lamanites\\nhad come upon them.\\n\\nMosiah 21:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that their continual cries did stir up\\nthe remainder of the people of Limhi to anger against the\\nLamanites; and they went again to battle, but they were driven\\nback again, suffering much loss.\\n\\nMosiah 21:12\\n 12 Yea, they went again even the third time, and suffered in the\\nlike manner; and those that were not slain returned again to the\\ncity of Nephi.\\n\\nMosiah 21:13\\n 13 And they did humble themselves even to the dust, subjecting\\nthemselves to the yoke of bondage, submitting themselves to be\\nsmitten, and to be driven to and fro, and burdened, according to\\nthe desires of their enemies.\\n\\nMosiah 21:14\\n 14 And they did humble themselves even in the depths of\\nhumility; and they did cry mightily to God; yea, even all the day\\nlong did they cry unto their God that he would deliver them out\\nof their afflictions.\\n\\nMosiah 21:15\\n 15 And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their\\niniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began\\nto soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease\\ntheir burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out\\nof bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 21:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that they began to prosper by degrees in\\nthe land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks,\\nand herds, that they did not suffer with hunger.\\n\\nMosiah 21:17\\n 17 Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of\\nmen; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should impart\\nto the support of the widows and their children, that they might\\nnot perish with hunger; and this they did because of the\\ngreatness of their number that had been slain.\\n\\nMosiah 21:18\\n 18 Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body as much as it\\nwas possible, and secured their grain and their flocks;\\n\\nMosiah 21:19\\n 19 And the king himself did not trust his person without the\\nwalls of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing\\nthat he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 21:20\\n 20 And he caused that his people should watch the land round\\nabout, that by some means they might take those priests that fled\\ninto the wilderness, who had stolen the daughters of the\\nLamanites, and that had caused such a great destruction to come\\nupon them.\\n\\nMosiah 21:21\\n 21 For they were desirous to take them that they might punish\\nthem; for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and\\ncarried off their grain and many of their precious things;\\ntherefore they laid wait for them.\\n\\nMosiah 21:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance\\nbetween the Lamanites and the people of Limhi, even until the\\ntime that Ammon and his brethren came into the land.\\n\\nMosiah 21:23\\n 23 And the king having been without the gates of the city with\\nhis guard, discovered Ammon and his brethren; and supposing them\\nto be priests of Noah therefore he caused that they should be\\ntaken, and bound, and cast into prison.  And had they been the\\npriests of Noah he would have caused that they should be put to\\ndeath.\\n\\nMosiah 21:24\\n 24 But when he found that they were not, but that they were his\\nbrethren, and had come from the land of Zarahemla, he was filled\\nwith exceedingly great joy.\\n\\nMosiah 21:25\\n 25 Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a\\nsmall number of men to search for the land of Zarahemla; but they\\ncould not find it, and they were lost in the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 21:26\\n 26 Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled;\\nyea, a land which was covered with dry bones; yea, a land which\\nhad been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having\\nsupposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of\\nNephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days\\nbefore the coming of Ammon.\\n\\nMosiah 21:27\\n 27 And they brought a record with them, even a record of the\\npeople whose bones they had found; and it was engraven on plates\\nof ore.\\n\\nMosiah 21:28\\n 28 And now Limhi was again filled with joy in learning from the\\nmouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had a gift from God, whereby he\\ncould interpret such engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice.\\n\\nMosiah 21:29\\n 29 Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow because so\\nmany of their brethren had been slain;\\n\\nMosiah 21:30\\n 30 And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people\\nto commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also\\ndid mourn for the death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of\\nAlma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church\\nof God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the\\nwords which had been spoken by Abinadi.\\n\\nMosiah 21:31\\n 31 Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not\\nwhither they had fled.  Now they would have gladly joined with\\nthem, for they themselves had entered into a covenant with God to\\nserve him and keep his commandments.\\n\\nMosiah 21:32\\n 32 And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi had also\\nentered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to\\nserve him and keep his commandments.\\n\\nMosiah 21:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his people\\nwere desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that\\nhad authority from God.  And Ammon declined doing this thing,\\nconsidering himself an unworthy servant.\\n\\nMosiah 21:34\\n 34 Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a\\nchurch, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord.  Now they were\\ndesirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled\\ninto the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 21:35\\n 35 They were desirous to be baptized as a witness and a\\ntestimony that they were willing to serve God with all their\\nhearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of\\ntheir baptism shall be given hereafter.\\n\\nMosiah 21:36\\n 36 And now all the study of Ammon and his people, and king Limhi\\nand his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the\\nLamanites and from bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 22\\nChapter 22\\n\\nMosiah 22:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to\\nconsult with the people how they should deliver themselves out of\\nbondage; and even they did cause that all the people should\\ngather themselves together; and this they did that they might\\nhave the voice of the people concerning the matter.\\n\\nMosiah 22:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver\\nthemselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and\\nchildren, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and\\ndepart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous,\\nit was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them,\\nthinking to deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword.\\n\\nMosiah 22:3\\n 3 Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and stood before\\nthe king, and said unto him: Now O king, thou hast hitherto\\nhearkened unto my words many times when we have been contending\\nwith our brethren, the Lamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 22:4\\n 4 And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an\\nunprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my\\nwords in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even\\nso I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time,\\nand I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 22:5\\n 5 And the king granted unto him that he might speak.  And Gideon\\nsaid unto him:\\n\\nMosiah 22:6\\n 6 Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side\\nof the city.  The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by\\nnight are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all\\nthis people that they gather together their flocks and herds,\\nthat they may drive them into the wilderness by night.\\n\\nMosiah 22:7\\n 7 And I will go according to thy command and pay the last\\ntribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and\\nwe will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp\\nwhen they are drunken and asleep.\\n\\nMosiah 22:8\\n 8 Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our\\nflocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel\\naround the land of Shilom.\\n\\nMosiah 22:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of\\nGideon.\\n\\nMosiah 22:10\\n 10 And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their\\nflocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the\\nLamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them;\\nand they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send\\nunto them.\\n\\nMosiah 22:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart\\nby night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds,\\nand they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness,\\nand bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by\\nAmmon and his brethren.\\n\\nMosiah 22:12\\n 12 And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their\\nprecious things, which they could carry, and also their\\nprovisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their\\njourney.\\n\\nMosiah 22:13\\n 13 And after being many days in the wilderness they arrived in\\nthe land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah's people, and became his\\nsubjects.\\n\\nMosiah 22:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and\\nhe also received their records, and also the records which had\\nbeen found by the people of Limhi.\\n\\nMosiah 22:15\\n 15 And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the\\npeople of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they\\nsent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;\\n\\nMosiah 22:16\\n 16 And after they had pursued them two days, they could no\\nlonger follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 23\\nChapter 23\\n\\nMosiah 23:1\\n 1 Now Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of\\nking Noah would come upon them, and having made it known to his\\npeople, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took\\nof their grain, and departed into the wilderness before the\\narmies of king Noah.\\n\\nMosiah 23:2\\n 2 And the Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah\\ncould not overtake them to destroy them.\\n\\nMosiah 23:3\\n 3 And they fled eight days' journey into the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 23:4\\n 4 And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and\\npleasant land, a land of pure water.\\n\\nMosiah 23:5\\n 5 And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground,\\nand began to build buildings; yea, they were industrious, and did\\nlabor exceedingly.\\n\\nMosiah 23:6\\n 6 And the people were desirous that Alma should be their king,\\nfor he was beloved by his people.\\n\\nMosiah 23:7\\n 7 But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we\\nshould have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem\\none flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above\\nanother; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye\\nshould have a king.\\n\\nMosiah 23:8\\n 8 Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have\\njust men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a\\nking.\\n\\nMosiah 23:9\\n 9 But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I\\nmyself was caught in a snare, and did many things which were\\nabominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore\\nrepentance;\\n\\nMosiah 23:10\\n 10 Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord did hear my\\ncries, and did answer my prayers, and has made me an instrument\\nin his hands in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his\\ntruth.\\n\\nMosiah 23:11\\n 11 Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to\\nglory of myself.\\n\\nMosiah 23:12\\n 12 And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah,\\nand have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been\\nbrought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the\\nbands of iniquity.\\n\\nMosiah 23:13\\n 13 And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of\\nthese bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his\\npeople, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire\\nthat ye should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been\\nmade free, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you.\\n\\nMosiah 23:14\\n 14 And also trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister,\\nexcept he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his\\ncommandments.\\n\\nMosiah 23:15\\n 15 Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should love\\nhis neighbor as himself, that there should be no contention among\\nthem.\\n\\nMosiah 23:16\\n 16 And now, Alma was their high priest, he being the founder of\\ntheir church.\\n\\nMosiah 23:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or\\nto teach except it were by him from God.  Therefore he\\nconsecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none\\nwere consecrated except they were just men.\\n\\nMosiah 23:18\\n 18 Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish\\nthem with things pertaining to righteousness.\\n\\nMosiah 23:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in\\nthe land; and they called the land Helam.\\n\\nMosiah 23:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that they did multiply and prosper\\nexceedingly in the land of Helam; and they built a city, which\\nthey called the city of Helam.\\n\\nMosiah 23:21\\n 21 Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea,\\nhe trieth their patience and their faith.\\n\\nMosiah 23:22\\n 22 Nevertheless--whosoever putteth his trust in him the same\\nshall be lifted up at the last day.  Yea, and thus it was with\\nthis people.\\n\\nMosiah 23:23\\n 23 For behold, I will show unto you that they were brought into\\nbondage, and none could deliver them but the Lord their God, yea,\\neven the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob.\\n\\nMosiah 23:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did show\\nforth his mighty power unto them, and great were their\\nrejoicings.\\n\\nMosiah 23:25\\n 25 For behold, it came to pass that while they were in the land\\nof Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land round\\nabout, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the\\nland.\\n\\nMosiah 23:26\\n 26 Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from their\\nfields, and gathered themselves together in the city of Helam;\\nand they were much frightened because of the appearance of the\\nLamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 23:27\\n 27 But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them\\nthat they should not be frightened, but that they should remember\\nthe Lord their God and he would deliver them.\\n\\nMosiah 23:28\\n 28 Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the\\nLord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they\\nwould spare them, and their wives, and their children.\\n\\nMosiah 23:29\\n 29 And it came to pass the the Lord did soften the hearts of the\\nLamanites.  And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered\\nthemselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession\\nof the land of Helam.\\n\\nMosiah 23:30\\n 30 Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had followed after the\\npeople of king Limhi, had been lost in the wilderness for many\\ndays.\\n\\nMosiah 23:31\\n 31 And behold, they had found those priests of king Noah, in a\\nplace which they called Amulon; and they had begun to possess the\\nland of Amulon and had begun to till the ground.\\n\\nMosiah 23:32\\n 32 Now the name of the leader of those priests was Amulon.\\n\\nMosiah 23:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that Amulon did plead with the Lamanites;\\nand he also sent forth their wives, who were the daughters of the\\nLamanites, to plead with their brethren, that they should not\\ndestroy their husbands.\\n\\nMosiah 23:34\\n 34 And the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and his brethren,\\nand did not destroy them, because of their wives.\\n\\nMosiah 23:35\\n 35 And Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they\\nwere traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi\\nwhen they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by\\nAlma and his brethren.\\n\\nMosiah 23:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and\\nhis brethren, that if they would show them the way which led to\\nthe land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and\\ntheir liberty.\\n\\nMosiah 23:37\\n 37 But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of\\nNephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set\\nguards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren.\\n\\nMosiah 23:38\\n 38 And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a\\npart of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with\\nthem the wives and the children of the guards who had been left\\nin the land.\\n\\nMosiah 23:39\\n 39 And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he\\nshould be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the\\nland of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do\\nanything contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 24\\nChapter 24\\n\\nMosiah 24:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of\\nthe king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites\\ngranted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed\\nteachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in\\nthe land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land\\nof Amulon.\\n\\nMosiah 24:2\\n 2 For the Lamanites had taken possession of all these lands;\\ntherefore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all\\nthese lands.\\n\\nMosiah 24:3\\n 3 And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was Laman, being\\ncalled after the name of his father; and therefore he was called\\nking Laman.  And he was king over a numerous people.\\n\\nMosiah 24:4\\n 4 And he appointed teachers of the brethren of Amulon in every\\nland which was possessed by his people; and thus the language of\\nNephi began to be taught among all the people of the Lamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 24:5\\n 5 And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless\\nthey knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them\\nanything concerning the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses;\\nnor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;\\n\\nMosiah 24:6\\n 6 But they taught them that they should keep their record, and\\nthat they might write one to another.\\n\\nMosiah 24:7\\n 7 And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began\\nto trade one with another and wax great, and began to be a\\ncunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a\\nvery cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and\\nplunder, except it were among their own brethren.\\n\\nMosiah 24:8\\n 8 And now it came to pass that Amulon began to exercise\\nauthority over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him,\\nand cause that his children should persecute their children.\\n\\nMosiah 24:9\\n 9 For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king's\\npriests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi\\nand was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth\\nwith him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised\\nauthority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put\\ntask-masters over them.\\n\\nMosiah 24:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that\\nthey began to cry mightily to God.\\n\\nMosiah 24:11\\n 11 And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries;\\nand he put guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should\\nbe found calling upon God should be put to death.\\n\\nMosiah 24:12\\n 12 And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the\\nLord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did\\nknow the thoughts of their hearts.\\n\\nMosiah 24:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them\\nin their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good\\ncomfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me;\\nand I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of\\nbondage.\\n\\nMosiah 24:14\\n 14 And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your\\nshoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even\\nwhile you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as\\nwitnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that\\nI, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.\\n\\nMosiah 24:15\\n 15 And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon\\nAlma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did\\nstrengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease,\\nand they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will\\nof the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 24:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their\\npatience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying:\\nBe of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of\\nbondage.\\n\\nMosiah 24:17\\n 17 And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and\\nI will go with thee and deliver this people out of bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 24:18\\n 18 Now it came to pass that Alma and his people in the\\nnight-time gathered their flocks together, and also of their\\ngrain; yea, even all the night-time were they gathering the\\nflocks together.\\n\\nMosiah 24:19\\n 19 And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon\\nthe Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound\\nsleep.\\n\\nMosiah 24:20\\n 20 And Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and\\nwhen they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a\\nvalley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led their way\\nin the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 24:21\\n 21 Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks\\nto God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their\\nburdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in\\nbondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord\\ntheir God.\\n\\nMosiah 24:22\\n 22 And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men and all their\\nwomen and all their children that could speak lifted their voices\\nin the praises of their God.\\n\\nMosiah 24:23\\n 23 And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and\\nthis people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and\\ndo pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will\\nstop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in\\npursuit of this people.\\n\\nMosiah 24:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and\\ntook their journey into the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 24:25\\n 25 And after they had been in the wilderness twelve days they\\narrived in the land of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also\\nreceive them with joy.\\n\\nMosiah 25\\nChapter 25\\n\\nMosiah 25:1\\n 1 And now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be\\ngathered together.\\n\\nMosiah 25:2\\n 2 Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so\\nmany of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the\\npeople of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who\\ncame with him into the wilderness.\\n\\nMosiah 25:3\\n 3 And there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the\\npeople of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they\\nwere not half so numerous.\\n\\nMosiah 25:4\\n 4 And now all the people of Nephi were assembled together, and\\nalso all the people of Zarahemla, and they were gathered together\\nin two bodies.\\n\\nMosiah 25:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be\\nread, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the\\nrecords of the people of Zeniff, from the time they left the land\\nof Zarahemla until they returned again.\\n\\nMosiah 25:6\\n 6 And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all\\ntheir afflictions, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla\\nuntil the time they returned again.\\n\\nMosiah 25:7\\n 7 And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records,\\nhis people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and\\namazement.\\n\\nMosiah 25:8\\n 8 For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those\\nthat had been delivered out of bondage they were filled with\\nexceedingly great joy.\\n\\nMosiah 25:9\\n 9 And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been\\nslain by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even\\nshed many tears of sorrow.\\n\\nMosiah 25:10\\n 10 And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of\\nGod, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the\\nhands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their\\nvoices and give thanks to God.\\n\\nMosiah 25:11\\n 11 And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were\\ntheir brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were\\nfilled with pain and anguish for the welfare of their souls.\\n\\nMosiah 25:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that those who were the children of\\nAmulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the daughters of\\nthe Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers,\\nand they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers,\\ntherefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they\\nmight be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those\\nwho were called Nephites.\\n\\nMosiah 25:13\\n 13 And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the\\nNephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon\\nnone but those who were descendants of Nephi.\\n\\nMosiah 25:14\\n 14 And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of\\nspeaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should\\nalso speak to the people.\\n\\nMosiah 25:15\\n 15 And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled\\ntogether in large bodies, and he went from one body to another,\\npreaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 25:16\\n 16 And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all\\nthose that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should\\nremember that it was the Lord that did deliver them.\\n\\nMosiah 25:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people\\nmany things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king\\nLimhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people\\nwere desirous that they might be baptized also.\\n\\nMosiah 25:18\\n 18 Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize\\nthem; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his\\nbrethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did\\nbaptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of\\ntheir belief on the words of Alma.\\n\\nMosiah 25:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that\\nhe might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla;\\nand gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every\\nchurch.\\n\\nMosiah 25:20\\n 20 Now this was done because there were so many people that they\\ncould not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all\\nhear the word of God in one assembly;\\n\\nMosiah 25:21\\n 21 Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different\\nbodies, being called churches; every church having their priests\\nand their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according\\nas it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.\\n\\nMosiah 25:22\\n 22 And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were\\nall one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was\\nnothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance\\nand faith in God.\\n\\nMosiah 25:23\\n 23 And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. \\nAnd it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon\\nthem the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of\\nGod;\\n\\nMosiah 25:24\\n 24 And they were called the people of God.  And the Lord did\\npour out his Spirit upon them, and they were blessed, and\\nprospered in the land.\\n\\nMosiah 26\\nChapter 26\\n\\nMosiah 26:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that there were many of the rising\\ngeneration that could not understand the words of king Benjamin,\\nbeing little children at the time he spake unto his people; and\\nthey did not believe the tradition of their fathers.\\n\\nMosiah 26:2\\n 2 They did not believe what had been said concerning the\\nresurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the\\ncoming of Christ.\\n\\nMosiah 26:3\\n 3 And now because of their unbelief they could not understand\\nthe word of God; and their hearts were hardened.\\n\\nMosiah 26:4\\n 4 And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the\\nchurch.  And they were a separate people as to their faith, and\\nremained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state;\\nfor they would not call upon the Lord their God.\\n\\nMosiah 26:5\\n 5 And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous\\nas the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the\\nbrethren they became more numerous.\\n\\nMosiah 26:6\\n 6 For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their\\nflattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to\\ncommit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who\\ncommitted sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by\\nthe church.\\n\\nMosiah 26:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests,\\nand delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the\\npriests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest.\\n\\nMosiah 26:8\\n 8 Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.\\n\\nMosiah 26:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them;\\nbut there were many witnesses against them; yea, the people stood\\nand testified of their iniquity in abundance.\\n\\nMosiah 26:10\\n 10 Now there had not any such thing happened before in the\\nchurch; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused\\nthat they should be brought before the king.\\n\\nMosiah 26:11\\n 11 And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have\\nbrought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and\\nthey have been taken in divers iniquities.  And they do not\\nrepent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before\\nthee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.\\n\\nMosiah 26:12\\n 12 But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not;\\ntherefore I deliver them into thy hands to be judged.\\n\\nMosiah 26:13\\n 13 And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went\\nand inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this\\nmatter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of\\nGod.\\n\\nMosiah 26:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole\\nsoul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:\\n\\nMosiah 26:15\\n 15 Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they who were\\nbaptized in the waters of Mormon.  Thou art blessed because of\\nthy exceeding faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.\\n\\nMosiah 26:16\\n 16 And blessed are they because of their exceeding faith in the\\nwords alone which thou hast spoken unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 26:17\\n 17 And blessed art thou because thou hast established a church\\namong this people; and they shall be established, and they shall\\nbe my people.\\n\\nMosiah 26:18\\n 18 Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name;\\nfor in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.\\n\\nMosiah 26:19\\n 19 And because thou hast inquired of me concerning the\\ntransgressor, thou art blessed.\\n\\nMosiah 26:20\\n 20 Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt\\nhave eternal life; and thou shalt serve me and go forth in my\\nname, and shalt gather together my sheep.\\n\\nMosiah 26:21\\n 21 And he that will hear my voice shall be my sheep; and him\\nshall ye receive into the church, and him will I also receive.\\n\\nMosiah 26:22\\n 22 For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be\\nbaptized unto repentance.  And whomsoever ye receive shall\\nbelieve in my name; and him will I freely forgive.\\n\\nMosiah 26:23\\n 23 For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it\\nis I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him\\nthat believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.\\n\\nMosiah 26:24\\n 24 For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know me\\nthey shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my\\nright hand.\\n\\nMosiah 26:25\\n 25 And it shall come to pass that when the second trump shall\\nsound then shall they that never knew me come forth and shall\\nstand before me.\\n\\nMosiah 26:26\\n 26 And then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that I\\nam their Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed.\\n\\nMosiah 26:27\\n 27 And then I will confess unto them that I never knew them; and\\nthey shall depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil\\nand his angels.\\n\\nMosiah 26:28\\n 28 Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my\\nvoice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I\\nwill not receive at the last day.\\n\\nMosiah 26:29\\n 29 Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth\\nagainst me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has\\ncommitted; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and\\nrepenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive,\\nand I will forgive him also.\\n\\nMosiah 26:30\\n 30 Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them\\ntheir trespasses against me.\\n\\nMosiah 26:31\\n 31 And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for\\nverily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor's\\ntrespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought\\nhimself under condemnation.\\n\\nMosiah 26:32\\n 32 Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his\\nsins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this\\nshall be observed from this time forward.\\n\\nMosiah 26:33\\n 33 And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote\\nthem down that he might have them, and that he might judge the\\npeople of that church according to the commandments of God.\\n\\nMosiah 26:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had\\nbeen taken in iniquity, according to the word of the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 26:35\\n 35 And whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them,\\nthem he did number among the people of the church;\\n\\nMosiah 26:36\\n 36 And those that would not confess their sins and repent of\\ntheir iniquity, the same were not numbered among the people of\\nthe church, and their names were blotted out.\\n\\nMosiah 26:37\\n 37 And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of\\nthe church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper\\nexceedingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly\\nbefore God, receiving many, and baptizing many.\\n\\nMosiah 26:38\\n 38 And now all these things did Alma and his fellow laborers do\\nwho were over the church, walking in all diligence, teaching the\\nword of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions,\\nbeing persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of\\nGod.\\n\\nMosiah 26:39\\n 39 And they did admonish their brethren; and they were also\\nadmonished, every one by the word of God, according to his sins,\\nor to the sins which he had committed, being commanded of God to\\npray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.\\n\\nMosiah 27\\nChapter 27\\n\\nMosiah 27:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that the persecutions which were\\ninflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that\\nthe church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders\\nconcerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma.  And Alma\\nlaid the case before their king, Mosiah.  And Mosiah consulted\\nwith his priests.\\n\\nMosiah 27:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation\\nthroughout the land round about that there should not any\\nunbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of\\nGod.\\n\\nMosiah 27:3\\n 3 And there was a strict command throughout all the churches\\nthat there should be no persecutions among them, that there\\nshould be an equality among all men;\\n\\nMosiah 27:4\\n 4 That they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their\\npeace; that every man should esteem his neighbor as himself,\\nlaboring with their own hands for their support.\\n\\nMosiah 27:5\\n 5 Yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with\\ntheir own hands for their support, in all cases save it were in\\nsickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did\\nabound in the grace of God.\\n\\nMosiah 27:6\\n 6 And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the\\npeople began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad\\nupon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south,\\non the east and on the west, building large cities and villages\\nin all quarters of the land.\\n\\nMosiah 27:7\\n 7 And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became\\na large and wealthy people.\\n\\nMosiah 27:8\\n 8 Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers;\\nand also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he\\nbeing called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a\\nvery wicked and an idolatrous man.  And he was a man of many\\nwords, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he\\nled many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.\\n\\nMosiah 27:9\\n 9 And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the\\nchurch of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing\\nmuch dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy\\nof God to exercise his power over them.\\n\\nMosiah 27:10\\n 10 And now it came to pass that while he was going about to\\ndestroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the\\nsons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray\\nthe people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or\\neven the king--\\n\\nMosiah 27:11\\n 11 And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling\\nagainst God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them;\\nand he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were\\nwith a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon\\nwhich they stood;\\n\\nMosiah 27:12\\n 12 And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the\\nearth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 27:13\\n 13 Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand\\nforth, for why persecutest thou the church of God?  For the Lord\\nhath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and\\nnothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my\\npeople.\\n\\nMosiah 27:14\\n 14 And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the\\nprayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma,\\nwho is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning\\nthee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth;\\ntherefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the\\npower and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants\\nmight be answered according to their faith.\\n\\nMosiah 27:15\\n 15 And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God?  For behold,\\ndoth not my voice shake the earth?  And can ye not also behold me\\nbefore you?  And I am sent from God.\\n\\nMosiah 27:16\\n 16 Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy\\nfathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and\\nremember how great things he has done for them; for they were in\\nbondage, and he has delivered them.  And now I say unto thee,\\nAlma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that\\ntheir prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of\\nthyself be cast off.\\n\\nMosiah 27:17\\n 17 And now it came to pass that these were the last words which\\nthe angel spake unto Alma, and he departed.\\n\\nMosiah 27:18\\n 18 And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the\\nearth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes\\nthey had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as\\nthunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was\\nnothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and\\ncause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.\\n\\nMosiah 27:19\\n 19 And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became\\ndumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak,\\neven that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by\\nthose that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was\\nlaid before his father.\\n\\nMosiah 27:20\\n 20 And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto\\nthem; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power\\nof God.\\n\\nMosiah 27:21\\n 21 And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together\\nthat they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and\\nalso for those that were with him.\\n\\nMosiah 27:22\\n 22 And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves\\ntogether; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their\\nGod that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak,\\nand also that his limbs might receive their strength--that the\\neyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the\\ngoodness and glory of God.\\n\\nMosiah 27:23\\n 23 And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the\\nspace of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received\\ntheir strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them,\\nbidding them to be of good comfort:\\n\\nMosiah 27:24\\n 24 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been\\nredeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.\\n\\nMosiah 27:25\\n 25 And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea,\\nmen and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be\\nborn again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and\\nfallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God,\\nbecoming his sons and daughters;\\n\\nMosiah 27:26\\n 26 And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this,\\nthey can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.\\n\\nMosiah 27:27\\n 27 I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast\\noff; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.\\n\\nMosiah 27:28\\n 28 Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulations,\\nrepenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to\\nsnatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.\\n\\nMosiah 27:29\\n 29 My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and\\nbonds of iniquity.  I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold\\nthe marvelous light of God.  My soul was racked with eternal\\ntorment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.\\n\\nMosiah 27:30\\n 30 I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken\\nof by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will\\ncome, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he\\nwill make himself manifest unto all.\\n\\nMosiah 27:31\\n 31 Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before\\nhim.  Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be\\njudged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall\\nthey confess, who live without God in the world, that the\\njudgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they\\nshall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his\\nall-searching eye.\\n\\nMosiah 27:32\\n 32 And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time\\nforward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the\\ntime the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through\\nall the land, publishing to all the people the things which they\\nhad heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much\\ntribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were\\nunbelievers, being smitten by many of them.\\n\\nMosiah 27:33\\n 33 But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much\\nconsolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting\\nthem with long-suffering and much travail to keep the\\ncommandments of God.\\n\\nMosiah 27:34\\n 34 And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names\\nwere Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names\\nof the sons of Mosiah.\\n\\nMosiah 27:35\\n 35 And they traveled throughout all the lands of Zarahemla, and\\namong all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah,\\nzealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done\\nto the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the\\nthings which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the\\nscriptures to all who desired to hear them.\\n\\nMosiah 27:36\\n 36 And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in\\nbringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the\\nknowledge of their Redeemer.\\n\\nMosiah 27:37\\n 37 And how blessed are they!  For they did publish peace; they\\ndid publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the\\npeople that the Lord reigneth.\\n\\nMosiah 28\\nChapter 28\\n\\nMosiah 28:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all\\nthese things, they took a small number with them and returned to\\ntheir father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant\\nunto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go\\nup to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which\\nthey had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to\\ntheir brethren, the Lamanites--\\n\\nMosiah 28:2\\n 2 That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the\\nLord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their\\nfathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred\\ntowards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice\\nin the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one\\nanother, and that there should be no more contentions in all the\\nland which the Lord their God had given them.\\n\\nMosiah 28:3\\n 3 Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to\\nevery creature, for they could not bear that any human soul\\nshould perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should\\nendure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.\\n\\nMosiah 28:4\\n 4 And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they\\nwere the very vilest of sinners.  And the Lord saw fit in his\\ninfinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much\\nanguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and\\nfearing that they should be cast off forever.\\n\\nMosiah 28:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many\\ndays that they might go up to the land of Nephi.\\n\\nMosiah 28:6\\n 6 And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let\\nhis sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.\\n\\nMosiah 28:7\\n 7 And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall\\nbelieve on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I\\nwill deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.\\n\\nMosiah 28:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that they might go and\\ndo according to their request.\\n\\nMosiah 28:9\\n 9 And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to\\npreach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account\\nof their proceedings hereafter.\\n\\nMosiah 28:10\\n 10 Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for\\nthere was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom.\\n\\nMosiah 28:11\\n 11 Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the\\nplates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things\\nwhich he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of\\nGod, after having translated and caused to be written the records\\nwhich were on the plates of gold which had been found by the\\npeople of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of\\nLimhi;\\n\\nMosiah 28:12\\n 12 And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people;\\nfor they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those\\npeople who had been destroyed.\\n\\nMosiah 28:13\\n 13 And now he translated them by the means of those two stones\\nwhich were fastened into the two rims of a bow.\\n\\nMosiah 28:14\\n 14 Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were\\nhanded down from generation to generation, for the purpose of\\ninterpreting languages;\\n\\nMosiah 28:15\\n 15 And they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the\\nLord, that he should discover to every creature who should\\npossess the land the iniquities and abominations of his people;\\n\\nMosiah 28:16\\n 16 And whosoever has these things is called seer, after the\\nmanner of old times.\\n\\nMosiah 28:17\\n 17 Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records,\\nbehold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from\\nthe time that they were destroyed back to the building of the\\ngreat tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the\\npeople and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the\\nearth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of\\nAdam.\\n\\nMosiah 28:18\\n 18 Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn\\nexceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it\\ngave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.\\n\\nMosiah 28:19\\n 19 And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it\\nis expedient that all people should know the things which are\\nwritten in this account.\\n\\nMosiah 28:20\\n 20 And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done\\nthese things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things\\nwhich he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son\\nof Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and\\nconferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep\\nand preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing\\nthem down from one generation to another, even as they had been\\nhanded down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.\\n\\nMosiah 29\\nChapter 29\\n\\nMosiah 29:1\\n 1 Now when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the\\nland, among all the people, desiring to know their will\\nconcerning who should be their king.\\n\\nMosiah 29:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying:\\nWe are desirous that Aaron thy son should be our king and our\\nruler.\\n\\nMosiah 29:3\\n 3 Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king\\ncould not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take\\nupon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah\\nwilling to take upon them the kingdom.\\n\\nMosiah 29:4\\n 4 Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a\\nwritten word sent he among the people.  And these were the words\\nthat were written, saying:\\n\\nMosiah 29:5\\n 5 Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I esteem you as\\nsuch, I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are\\ncalled to consider--for ye are desirous to have a king.\\n\\nMosiah 29:6\\n 6 Now I declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth\\nrightly belong has declined, and will not take upon him the\\nkingdom.\\n\\nMosiah 29:7\\n 7 And now if there should be another appointed in his stead,\\nbehold I fear there would rise contentions among you.  And who\\nknoweth but what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should\\nturn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him,\\nwhich would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be\\nthe cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the\\nLord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people.\\n\\nMosiah 29:8\\n 8 Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things,\\nfor we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have\\nany right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his\\nstead.\\n\\nMosiah 29:9\\n 9 And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things\\nhe would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right\\nto the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to\\ncommit much sin.\\n\\nMosiah 29:10\\n 10 And now let us be wise and look forward to these things, and\\ndo that which will make for the peace of this people.\\n\\nMosiah 29:11\\n 11 Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days;\\nnevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this people\\naccording to our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of\\nthis people, for we will appoint wise men to be judges, that will\\njudge this people according to the commandments of God.\\n\\nMosiah 29:12\\n 12 Now it is better that a man should be judged of God than of\\nman, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments\\nof man are not always just.\\n\\nMosiah 29:13\\n 13 Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men\\nto be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge\\nthis people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have\\nmen for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did\\nfor this people--I say unto you, if this could always be the case\\nthen it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to\\nrule over you.\\n\\nMosiah 29:14\\n 14 And even I myself have labored with all the power and\\nfaculties which I have possessed, to teach you the commandments\\nof God, and to establish peace throughout the land, that there\\nshould be no wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering,\\nnor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity;\\n\\nMosiah 29:15\\n 15 And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I punished\\naccording to the crime which he has committed, according to the\\nlaw which has been given to us by our fathers.\\n\\nMosiah 29:16\\n 16 Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is\\nnot expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over\\nyou.\\n\\nMosiah 29:17\\n 17 For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause to\\nbe committed, yea, and what great destruction!\\n\\nMosiah 29:18\\n 18 Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations,\\nand also the wickedness and abominations of his people.  Behold\\nwhat great destruction did come upon them; and also because of\\ntheir iniquities they were brought into bondage.\\n\\nMosiah 29:19\\n 19 And were it not for the interposition of their all-wise\\nCreator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they must\\nunavoidably remain in bondage until now.\\n\\nMosiah 29:20\\n 20 But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble\\nthemselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him\\nhe did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work\\nwith his power in all cases among the children of men, extending\\nthe arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.\\n\\nMosiah 29:21\\n 21 And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an\\niniquitous king save it be through much contention, and the\\nshedding of much blood.\\n\\nMosiah 29:22\\n 22 For behold, he has his friends in iniquity, and he keepeth\\nhis guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who\\nhave reigned in righteousness before him; and he trampleth under\\nhis feet the commandments of God;\\n\\nMosiah 29:23\\n 23 And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his\\npeople, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and\\nwhosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and\\nwhosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against\\nthem to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an\\nunrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.\\n\\nMosiah 29:24\\n 24 And now behold I say unto you, it is not expedient that such\\nabominations should come upon you.\\n\\nMosiah 29:25\\n 25 Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges,\\nthat ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given\\nyou by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them\\nby the hand of the Lord.\\n\\nMosiah 29:26\\n 26 Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth\\nanything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for\\nthe lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right;\\ntherefore this shall ye observe and make it your law--to do your\\nbusiness by the voice of the people.\\n\\nMosiah 29:27\\n 27 And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth\\nchoose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will\\ncome upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great\\ndestruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.\\n\\nMosiah 29:28\\n 28 And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you\\naccording to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they\\nmay be judged of a higher judge.\\n\\nMosiah 29:29\\n 29 If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye\\nshall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be\\ngathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges,\\naccording to the voice of the people.\\n\\nMosiah 29:30\\n 30 And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord;\\nand I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king;\\nthat if these people commit sins and iniquities they shall be\\nanswered upon their own heads.\\n\\nMosiah 29:31\\n 31 For behold I say unto you, the sins of many people have been\\ncaused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore their\\niniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.\\n\\nMosiah 29:32\\n 32 And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in\\nthis land, especially among this my people; but I desire that\\nthis land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his\\nrights and privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we\\nmay live and inherit the land, yea, even as long as any of our\\nposterity remains upon the face of the land.\\n\\nMosiah 29:33\\n 33 And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them,\\nunfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous\\nking, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also\\nall the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained\\nit all unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 29:34\\n 34 And he told them that these things ought not to be; but that\\nthe burden should come upon all the people, that every man might\\nbear his part.\\n\\nMosiah 29:35\\n 35 And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they\\nlabored under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them;\\n\\nMosiah 29:36\\n 36 Yea, all his iniquities and abominations, and all the wars,\\nand contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the\\nplundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of\\niniquities which cannot be enumerated--telling them that these\\nthings ought not to be, that they were expressly repugnant to the\\ncommandments of God.\\n\\nMosiah 29:37\\n 37 And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had sent these\\nthings forth among the people they were convinced of the truth of\\nhis words.\\n\\nMosiah 29:38\\n 38 Therefore they relinquished their desires for a king, and\\nbecame exceedingly anxious that every man should have an equal\\nchance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a\\nwillingness to answer for his own sins.\\n\\nMosiah 29:39\\n 39 Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled themselves\\ntogether in bodies throughout the land, to cast in their voices\\nconcerning who should be their judges, to judge them according to\\nthe law which had been given them; and they were exceedingly\\nrejoiced because of the liberty which had been granted unto them.\\n\\nMosiah 29:40\\n 40 And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did\\nesteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon\\nhim as a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre\\nwhich doth corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches of\\nthem, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he\\nhad established peace in the land, and he had granted unto his\\npeople that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage;\\ntherefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.\\n\\nMosiah 29:41\\n 41 And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to rule over\\nthem, or to judge them according to the law; and this they did\\nthroughout all the land.\\n\\nMosiah 29:42\\n 42 And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first\\nchief judge, he being also the high priest, his father having\\nconferred the office upon him, and having given him the charge\\nconcerning all the affairs of the church.\\n\\nMosiah 29:43\\n 43 And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the\\nLord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did judge\\nrighteous judgments; and there was continual peace through the\\nland.\\n\\nMosiah 29:44\\n 44 And thus commenced the reign of the judges throughout all the\\nland of Zarahemla, among all the people who were called the\\nNephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.\\n\\nMosiah 29:45\\n 45 And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty\\nand two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of\\nGod.\\n\\nMosiah 29:46\\n 46 And it came to pass that Mosiah died also, in the thirty and\\nthird year of his reign, being sixty and three years old; making\\nin the whole, five hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left\\nJerusalem.\\n\\nMosiah 29:47\\n 47 And thus ended the reign of the kings over the people of\\nNephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who was the founder of\\ntheir church.\\n\\nAlma\\nTHE BOOK OF ALMA\\nTHE SON OF ALMA\\nThe account of Alma, who was the son of Alma the first, and chief\\njudge over the people of Nephi, and also the high priest over the\\nChurch.   An account of the reign of the judges, and the wars and\\ncontentions among the people.   And also an account of a war\\nbetween the Nephites and the Lamanites, according to the record\\nof Alma, the first and chief judge.\\n\\nAlma 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\nAlma 1:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king\\nMosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good\\nwarfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in\\nhis stead; nevertheless he had established laws, and they were\\nacknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide\\nby the laws which he had made.\\n\\nAlma 1:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of\\nAlma in the judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to\\nbe judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much\\nstrength.\\n\\nAlma 1:3\\n 3 And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that\\nwhich he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the\\nchurch; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher\\nought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their\\nhands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.\\n\\nAlma 1:4\\n 4 And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should\\nbe saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor\\ntremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for\\nthe Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and,\\nin the end, all men should have eternal life.\\n\\nAlma 1:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much\\nthat many did believe on his words, even so many that they began\\nto support him and give him money.\\n\\nAlma 1:6\\n 6 And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to\\nwear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a\\nchurch after the manner of his preaching.\\n\\nAlma 1:7\\n 7 And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who\\nbelieved on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of\\nGod, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend\\nwith him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the\\nchurch; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words\\nof God.\\n\\nAlma 1:8\\n 8 Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an\\ninstrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi\\nout of bondage.\\n\\nAlma 1:9\\n 9 Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was\\nwroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him. \\nNow Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not\\nable to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.\\n\\nAlma 1:10\\n 10 And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the\\nchurch, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to\\nthe crimes which he had committed.\\n\\nAlma 1:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pleaded for\\nhimself with much boldness.\\n\\nAlma 1:12\\n 12 But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that\\npriestcraft has been introduced among this people.  And behold,\\nthou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to\\nenforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced\\namong this people it would prove their entire destruction.\\n\\nAlma 1:13\\n 13 And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man\\nwho has done much good among this people; and were we to spare\\nthee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.\\n\\nAlma 1:14\\n 14 Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law\\nwhich has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been\\nacknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by\\nthe law.\\n\\nAlma 1:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was\\nNehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and\\nthere he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the\\nheavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was\\ncontrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious\\ndeath.\\n\\nAlma 1:16\\n 16 Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of\\npriestcraft through the land; for there were many who loved the\\nvain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false\\ndoctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.\\n\\nAlma 1:17\\n 17 Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear\\nof the law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to\\npreach according to their belief; and now the law could have no\\npower on any man for his belief.\\n\\nAlma 1:18\\n 18 And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were\\npunished; neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that\\nmurdered was punished unto death.\\n\\nAlma 1:19\\n 19 But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the\\nchurch of God began to persecute those that did belong to the\\nchurch of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.\\n\\nAlma 1:20\\n 20 Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all\\nmanner of words, and this because of their humility; because they\\nwere not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the\\nword of God, one with another, without money and without price.\\n\\nAlma 1:21\\n 21 Now there was a strict law among the people of the church\\nthat there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and\\npersecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there\\nshould be no persecution among themselves.\\n\\nAlma 1:22\\n 22 Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be\\nproud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even\\nunto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.\\n\\nAlma 1:23\\n 23 Now this was in the second year of the reign of Alma, and it\\nwas a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the\\ncause of much trial with the church.\\n\\nAlma 1:24\\n 24 For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were\\nblotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people\\nof God.  And also many withdrew themselves from among them.\\n\\nAlma 1:25\\n 25 Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in\\nthe faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in\\nkeeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the\\npersecution which was heaped upon them.\\n\\nAlma 1:26\\n 26 And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of\\nGod unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear\\nthe word of God.  And when the priest had imparted unto them the\\nword of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors;\\nand the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the\\npreacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher\\nany better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and\\nthey did all labor, every man according to his strength.\\n\\nAlma 1:27\\n 27 And they did impart of their substance, every man according\\nto that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick,\\nand the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they\\nwere neat and comely.\\n\\nAlma 1:28\\n 28 And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and\\nthus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding\\nall their persecutions.\\n\\nAlma 1:29\\n 29 And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began\\nto be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever\\nthey stood in need--an abundance of flocks and herds, and\\nfatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold,\\nand of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and\\nfine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.\\n\\nAlma 1:30\\n 30 And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not\\nsend away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were\\nathirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and\\nthey did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were\\nliberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male\\nand female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no\\nrespect to persons as to those who stood in need.\\n\\nAlma 1:31\\n 31 And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than\\nthose who did not belong to their church.\\n\\nAlma 1:32\\n 32 For those who did not belong to their church did indulge\\nthemselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in\\nbabblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel;\\nbeing lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting,\\nlying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering,\\nand all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in\\nforce upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was\\npossible.\\n\\nAlma 1:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon\\nthem, every man suffering according to that which he had done,\\nthey became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it\\nwere known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of\\nNephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.\\n\\nAlma 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\nAlma 2:1\\n 1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fifth year of\\ntheir reign there began to be a contention among the people; for\\na certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man,\\nyea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the\\norder of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed\\naccording to the law--\\n\\nAlma 2:2\\n 2 Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people\\nafter him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and\\nthey began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be king over the\\npeople.\\n\\nAlma 2:3\\n 3 Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to\\nall those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of\\nAmlici; for they knew that according to their law that such\\nthings must be established by the voice of the people.\\n\\nAlma 2:4\\n 4 Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the\\nvoice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them\\nof their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his\\nintent to destroy the church of God.\\n\\nAlma 2:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves\\ntogether throughout all the land, every man according to his\\nmind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies,\\nhaving much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another.\\n\\nAlma 2:6\\n 6 And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in\\ntheir voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the\\njudges.\\n\\nAlma 2:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against\\nAmlici, that he was not made king over the people.\\n\\nAlma 2:8\\n 8 Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were\\nagainst him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor\\nto anger against those who were not in his favor.\\n\\nAlma 2:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together,\\nand did consecrate Amlici to be their king.\\n\\nAlma 2:10\\n 10 Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them\\nthat they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he\\ndid that he might subject them to him.\\n\\nAlma 2:11\\n 11 Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of\\nAmlici, being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called\\nNephites, or the people of God.\\n\\nAlma 2:12\\n 12 Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent\\nof the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them;\\nyea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and\\nwith bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and\\nwith all manner of weapons of war, of every kind.\\n\\nAlma 2:13\\n 13 And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time\\nof their coming.  And there were appointed captains, and higher\\ncaptains, and chief captains, according to their numbers.\\n\\nAlma 2:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all\\nmanner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed\\nrulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against\\ntheir brethren.\\n\\nAlma 2:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill\\nAmnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land\\nof Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 2:16\\n 16 Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the\\npeople of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with\\nhis captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies,\\nagainst the Amlicites to battle.\\n\\nAlma 2:17\\n 17 And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of\\nSidon.  And the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with\\ngreat strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall\\nbefore the Amlicites.\\n\\nAlma 2:18\\n 18 Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the\\nNephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that\\nthey began to flee before them.\\n\\nAlma 2:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the\\nAmlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter,\\ninsomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand\\nfive hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the\\nNephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.\\n\\nAlma 2:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites\\nno longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in\\nthe valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon\\nwho was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this\\nvalley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.\\n\\nAlma 2:21\\n 21 And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites,\\nthat he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he\\nmight guard himself against them, that he might preserve his\\npeople from being destroyed.\\n\\nAlma 2:22\\n 22 Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the\\nAmlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher;\\nthese were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of\\nthe Amlicites.\\n\\nAlma 2:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the\\ncamp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished,\\nand struck with much fear, saying:\\n\\nAlma 2:24\\n 24 Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our\\ngreat astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of\\nZarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous\\nhost of the Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined\\nthem;\\n\\nAlma 2:25\\n 25 And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are\\nfleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their\\nchildren, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain\\npossession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our\\nchildren be slain.\\n\\nAlma 2:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their\\ntents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their\\ncity, which was the city of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 2:27\\n 27 And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the\\nLamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it\\nwere, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them.\\n\\nAlma 2:28\\n 28 Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of\\nthe Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver\\nthem out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did\\nhear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and\\nthe Amlicites did fall before them.\\n\\nAlma 2:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the\\nsword, face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with\\nanother.\\n\\nAlma 2:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being\\nexercised with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and\\nspare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save\\nand preserve this people.\\n\\nAlma 2:31\\n 31 Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with\\nAmlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici\\nwith the sword.\\n\\nAlma 2:32\\n 32 And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the\\nking of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his\\nguards to contend with Alma.\\n\\nAlma 2:33\\n 33 But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the\\nking of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.\\n\\nAlma 2:34\\n 34 And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was\\non the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the\\nLamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that\\nthereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the\\nLamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon.\\n\\nAlma 2:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river\\nSidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before\\nthem, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not\\nbe numbered.\\n\\nAlma 2:36\\n 36 And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness\\nwhich was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land;\\nand the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 2:37\\n 37 Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until\\nthey were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had\\nreached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was\\nthat part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and\\nravenous beasts.\\n\\nAlma 2:38\\n 38 And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their\\nwounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures\\nof the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped\\nup on the earth.\\n\\nAlma 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\nAlma 3:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by\\nthe weapons of war, after having buried those who had been\\nslain--now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of\\nthe greatness of their number--after they had finished burying\\ntheir dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses,\\nand their wives, and their children.\\n\\nAlma 3:2\\n 2 Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and\\nalso many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their\\nfields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the\\nhosts of men.\\n\\nAlma 3:3\\n 3 And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had\\nbeen slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the\\nwaters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the\\nsea, and they are many.\\n\\nAlma 3:4\\n 4 And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for\\nthey had marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the\\nmanner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their\\nheads like unto the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 3:5\\n 5 Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were\\nnaked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and\\nalso their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows,\\nand their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so\\nforth.\\n\\nAlma 3:6\\n 6 And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the\\nmark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon\\nthem because of their transgression and their rebellion against\\ntheir brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and\\nSam, who were just and holy men.\\n\\nAlma 3:7\\n 7 And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were\\ncursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman\\nand Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.\\n\\nAlma 3:8\\n 8 And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from\\nthe seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might\\npreserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in\\nincorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.\\n\\nAlma 3:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with\\nthat of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.\\n\\nAlma 3:10\\n 10 Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the\\nLamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set\\nupon him.\\n\\nAlma 3:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the\\ntradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were\\nbrought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition\\nof their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the\\ncommandments of God and kept them, were called the Nephites, or\\nthe people of Nephi, from that time forth--\\n\\nAlma 3:12\\n 12 And it is they who have kept the records which are true of\\ntheir people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 3:13\\n 13 Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had\\na mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves,\\nyea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads.\\n\\nAlma 3:14\\n 14 Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words\\nwhich he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and\\nI will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be\\nseparated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and\\nforever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me\\nthat I may have mercy upon them.\\n\\nAlma 3:15\\n 15 And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed\\nwith thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.\\n\\nAlma 3:16\\n 16 And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against\\nthee and thy seed.\\n\\nAlma 3:17\\n 17 And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be\\ncalled thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be\\ncalled thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the\\npromises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.\\n\\nAlma 3:18\\n 18 Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the\\nwords of God when they began to mark themselves in their\\nforeheads; nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion\\nagainst God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should\\nfall upon them.\\n\\nAlma 3:19\\n 19 Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon\\nthemselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed\\nbring upon himself his own condemnation.\\n\\nAlma 3:20\\n 20 Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which\\nwas fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the\\nAmlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in\\nupon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army\\nmet the Amlicites.\\n\\nAlma 3:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them\\nout of their land.\\n\\nAlma 3:22\\n 22 Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up\\nto battle at this time against the Lamanites;\\n\\nAlma 3:23\\n 23 But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up\\nand slew many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them\\nout of the borders of their land.\\n\\nAlma 3:24\\n 24 And then they returned again and began to establish peace in\\nthe land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.\\n\\nAlma 3:25\\n 25 Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and\\ncontentions were commenced and ended in the fifth year of the\\nreign of the judges.\\n\\nAlma 3:26\\n 26 And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls\\nsent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards\\naccording to their works, whether they were good or whether they\\nwere bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according\\nto the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good\\nspirit or a bad one.\\n\\nAlma 3:27\\n 27 For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey,\\nand this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy;\\ntherefore let it be according to the truth.  And thus endeth the\\nfifth year of the reign of the judges.\\n\\nAlma 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\nAlma 4:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass in the sixth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor\\nwars in the land of Zarahemla;\\n\\nAlma 4:2\\n 2 But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the\\nloss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and\\nherds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were\\ntrodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 4:3\\n 3 And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause\\nto mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent\\nupon them because of their wickedness and their abominations;\\ntherefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.\\n\\nAlma 4:4\\n 4 And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and\\nmany were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the\\nchurch of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who\\nhad been consecrated the high priest over the people of the\\nchurch, by the hand of his father Alma.\\n\\nAlma 4:5\\n 5 And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the\\njudges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that\\nunited themselves to the church of God and were baptized.  And\\nthus endeth the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the\\npeople of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.\\n\\nAlma 4:6\\n 6 And it came to pass in the eighth year of the reign of the\\njudges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because\\nof their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their\\nfine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds,\\nand their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious\\nthings, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all\\nthese things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for\\nthey began to wear very costly apparel.\\n\\nAlma 4:7\\n 7 Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to\\nmany of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and\\npriests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were\\nsorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be\\namong their people.\\n\\nAlma 4:8\\n 8 For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of\\nthe church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and\\nto set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the\\nworld, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and\\nthey began to persecute those that did not believe according to\\ntheir own will and pleasure.\\n\\nAlma 4:9\\n 9 And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges,\\nthere began to be great contentions among the people of the\\nchurch; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and\\npersecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who\\ndid not belong to the church of God.\\n\\nAlma 4:10\\n 10 And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges;\\nand the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to\\nthose who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began\\nto fail in its progress.\\n\\nAlma 4:11\\n 11 And it came to pass in the commencement of the ninth year,\\nAlma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the\\nexample of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on\\nfrom one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the\\ndestruction of the people.\\n\\nAlma 4:12\\n 12 Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting\\nthemselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their\\nbacks upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and\\nthose who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.\\n\\nAlma 4:13\\n 13 Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people,\\nwhile others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood\\nin need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the\\npoor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner\\nof afflictions, for Christ's sake, who should come according to\\nthe spirit of prophecy;\\n\\nAlma 4:14\\n 14 Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of\\ntheir sins; being filled with great joy because of the\\nresurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and\\ndeliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.\\n\\nAlma 4:15\\n 15 And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the\\nafflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions\\nwhich were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and\\nseeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful;\\nnevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.\\n\\nAlma 4:16\\n 16 And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the\\nchurch, and gave him power according to the voice of the people,\\nthat he might have power to enact laws according to the laws\\nwhich had been given, and to put them in force according to the\\nwickedness and the crimes of the people.\\n\\nAlma 4:17\\n 17 Now this man's name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief\\njudge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the\\npeople.\\n\\nAlma 4:18\\n 18 Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high\\npriest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest\\nunto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.\\n\\nAlma 4:19\\n 19 And this he did that he himself might go forth among his\\npeople, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the\\nword of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their\\nduty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the\\npride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his\\npeople, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in\\nbearing down in pure testimony against them.\\n\\nAlma 4:20\\n 20 And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign\\nof the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the\\njudgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the\\nhigh priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the\\nword, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.\\n\\nAlma 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\nAlma 5:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that Alma began to deliver the word of God\\nunto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence\\nthroughout all the land.\\n\\nAlma 5:2\\n 2 And these are the words which he spake to the people in the\\nchurch which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according\\nto his own record, saying:\\n\\nAlma 5:3\\n 3 I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a\\nhigh priest over the church of God, he having power and authority\\nfrom God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began\\nto establish a church in the land which was in the borders of\\nNephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea,\\nand he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.\\n\\nAlma 5:4\\n 4 And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the\\nhands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.\\n\\nAlma 5:5\\n 5 And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the\\nhands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you,\\nthey were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out\\nof bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into\\nthis land, and here we began to establish the church of God\\nthroughout this land also.\\n\\nAlma 5:6\\n 6 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong\\nto this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the\\ncaptivity of your fathers?  Yea, and have you sufficiently\\nretained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards\\nthem?  And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance\\nthat he has delivered their souls from hell?\\n\\nAlma 5:7\\n 7 Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of\\na deep sleep, and they awoke unto God.  Behold, they were in the\\nmidst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by\\nthe light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about\\nby the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting\\ndestruction did await them.\\n\\nAlma 5:8\\n 8 And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed? \\nBehold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.\\n\\nAlma 5:9\\n 9 And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the\\nchains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed?  I\\nsay unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand,\\nand they did sing redeeming love.  And I say unto you that they\\nare saved.\\n\\nAlma 5:10\\n 10 And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved?  Yea,\\nwhat grounds had they to hope for salvation?  What is the cause\\nof their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the\\nchains of hell?\\n\\nAlma 5:11\\n 11 Behold, I can tell you--did not my father Alma believe in the\\nwords which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi?  And was he\\nnot a holy prophet?  Did he not speak the words of God, and my\\nfather Alma believe them?\\n\\nAlma 5:12\\n 12 And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought\\nin his heart.  Behold I say unto you that this is all true.\\n\\nAlma 5:13\\n 13 And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a\\nmighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled\\nthemselves and put their trust in the true and living God.  And\\nbehold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were\\nsaved.\\n\\nAlma 5:14\\n 14 And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have\\nye spiritually been born of God?  Have ye received his image in\\nyour countenances?  Have ye experienced this mighty change in\\nyour hearts?\\n\\nAlma 5:15\\n 15 Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created\\nyou?  Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this\\nmortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in\\nincorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the\\ndeeds which have been done in the mortal body?\\n\\nAlma 5:16\\n 16 I say unto you, can you imagine to yourselves that ye hear\\nthe voice of the Lord, saying unto you, in that day: Come unto me\\nye blessed, for behold, your works have been the works of\\nrighteousness upon the face of the earth?\\n\\nAlma 5:17\\n 17 Or do ye imagine to yourselves that ye can lie unto the Lord\\nin that day, and say--Lord, our works have been righteous works\\nupon the face of the earth--and that he will save you?\\n\\nAlma 5:18\\n 18 Or otherwise, can ye imagine yourselves brought before the\\ntribunal of God with your souls filled with guilt and remorse,\\nhaving a remembrance of all your guilt, yea, a perfect\\nremembrance of all your wickedness, yea, a remembrance that ye\\nhave set at defiance the commandments of God?\\n\\nAlma 5:19\\n 19 I say unto you, can ye look up to God at that day with a pure\\nheart and clean hands?  I say unto you, can you look up, having\\nthe image of God engraven upon your countenances?\\n\\nAlma 5:20\\n 20 I say unto you, can ye think of being saved when you have\\nyielded yourselves to become subjects to the devil?\\n\\nAlma 5:21\\n 21 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be\\nsaved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are\\nwashed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are\\ncleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has\\nbeen spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people\\nfrom their sins.\\n\\nAlma 5:22\\n 22 And now I ask of you, my brethren, how will any of you feel,\\nif ye shall stand before the bar of God, having your garments\\nstained with blood and all manner of filthiness?  Behold, what\\nwill these things testify against you?\\n\\nAlma 5:23\\n 23 Behold will they not testify that ye are murderers, yea, and\\nalso that ye are guilty of all manner of wickedness?\\n\\nAlma 5:24\\n 24 Behold, my brethren, do ye suppose that such an one can have\\na place to sit down in the kingdom of God, with Abraham, with\\nIsaac, and with Jacob, and also all the holy prophets, whose\\ngarments are cleansed and are spotless, pure and white?\\n\\nAlma 5:25\\n 25 I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from\\nthe beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning,\\nye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of\\nheaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of\\nthe kingdom of the devil.\\n\\nAlma 5:26\\n 26 And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have\\nexperienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the\\nsong of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?\\n\\nAlma 5:27\\n 27 Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? \\nCould ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within\\nyourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble?  That your\\ngarments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of\\nChrist, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?\\n\\nAlma 5:28\\n 28 Behold, are ye stripped of pride?  I say unto you, if ye are\\nnot ye are not prepared to meet God.  Behold ye must prepare\\nquickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an\\none hath not eternal life.\\n\\nAlma 5:29\\n 29 Behold, I say, is there one among you who is not stripped of\\nenvy?  I say unto you that such an one is not prepared; and I\\nwould that he should prepare quickly, for the hour is close at\\nhand, and he knoweth not when the time shall come; for such an\\none is not found guiltless.\\n\\nAlma 5:30\\n 30 And again I say unto you, is there one among you that doth\\nmake a mock of his brother, or that heapeth upon him\\npersecutions?\\n\\nAlma 5:31\\n 31 Wo unto such an one, for he is not prepared, and the time is\\nat hand that he must repent or he cannot be saved!\\n\\nAlma 5:32\\n 32 Yea, even wo unto all ye workers of iniquity; repent, repent,\\nfor the Lord God hath spoken it!\\n\\nAlma 5:33\\n 33 Behold, he sendeth an invitation unto all men, for the arms\\nof mercy are extended towards them, and he saith: Repent, and I\\nwill receive you.\\n\\nAlma 5:34\\n 34 Yea, he saith: Come unto me and ye shall partake of the fruit\\nof the tree of life; yea, ye shall eat and drink of the bread and\\nthe waters of life freely;\\n\\nAlma 5:35\\n 35 Yea, come unto me and bring forth works of righteousness, and\\nye shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire--\\n\\nAlma 5:36\\n 36 For behold, the time is at hand that whosoever bringeth forth\\nnot good fruit, or whosoever doeth not the works of\\nrighteousness, the same have cause to wail and mourn.\\n\\nAlma 5:37\\n 37 O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain\\nthings of the world, ye that have professed to have known the\\nways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep\\nhaving no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after\\nyou and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto\\nhis voice!\\n\\nAlma 5:38\\n 38 Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you;\\nyea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of\\nChrist; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good\\nshepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not\\nthe sheep of the good shepherd.\\n\\nAlma 5:39\\n 39 And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what\\nfold are ye?  Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your\\nshepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? \\nBehold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a\\nchild of the devil.\\n\\nAlma 5:40\\n 40 For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God,\\nand whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil.\\n\\nAlma 5:41\\n 41 Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth\\nunto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but\\nwhosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of\\nthe devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.\\n\\nAlma 5:42\\n 42 And whosoever doeth this must receive his wages of him;\\ntherefore, for his wages he receiveth death, as to things\\npertaining unto righteousness, being dead unto all good works.\\n\\nAlma 5:43\\n 43 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I\\nspeak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto\\nyou plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the\\ncommandments of God.\\n\\nAlma 5:44\\n 44 For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the\\nholy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded\\nto stand and testify unto this people the things which have been\\nspoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.\\n\\nAlma 5:45\\n 45 And this is not all.  Do ye not suppose that I know of these\\nthings myself?  Behold, I testify unto you that I do know that\\nthese things whereof I have spoken are true.  And how do ye\\nsuppose that I know of their surety?\\n\\nAlma 5:46\\n 46 Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the\\nHoly Spirit of God.  Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days\\nthat I might know these things of myself.  And now I do know of\\nmyself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them\\nmanifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of\\nrevelation which is in me.\\n\\nAlma 5:47\\n 47 And moreover, I say unto you that it has thus been revealed\\nunto me, that the words which have been spoken by our fathers are\\ntrue, even so according to the spirit of prophecy which is in me,\\nwhich is also by the manifestation of the Spirit of God.\\n\\nAlma 5:48\\n 48 I say unto you, that I know of myself that whatsoever I shall\\nsay unto you, concerning that which is to come, is true; and I\\nsay unto you, that I know that Jesus Christ shall come, yea, the\\nSon, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, and mercy,\\nand truth.  And behold, it is he that cometh to take away the\\nsins of the world, yea, the sins of every man who steadfastly\\nbelieveth on his name.\\n\\nAlma 5:49\\n 49 And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I\\nam called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and\\nevery one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all,\\nboth old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the\\naged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea,\\nto cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.\\n\\nAlma 5:50\\n 50 Yea, thus saith the Spirit: Repent, all ye ends of the earth,\\nfor the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand; yea, the Son of God\\ncometh in his glory, in his might, majesty, power, and dominion. \\nYea, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, that the Spirit saith:\\nBehold the glory of the King of all the earth; and also the King\\nof heaven shall very soon shine forth among all the children of\\nmen.\\n\\nAlma 5:51\\n 51 And also the Spirit saith unto me, yea, crieth unto me with a\\nmighty voice, saying: Go forth and say unto this people--Repent,\\nfor except ye repent ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of\\nheaven.\\n\\nAlma 5:52\\n 52 And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is\\nlaid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth\\nnot forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire,\\nyea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire. \\nBehold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.\\n\\nAlma 5:53\\n 53 And now my beloved brethren, I say unto you, can ye withstand\\nthese sayings; yea, can ye lay aside these things, and trample\\nthe Holy One under your feet; yea, can ye be puffed up in the\\npride of your hearts; yea, will ye still persist in the wearing\\nof costly apparel and setting your hearts upon the vain things of\\nthe world, upon your riches?\\n\\nAlma 5:54\\n 54 Yea, will ye persist in supposing that ye are better one than\\nanother; yea, will ye persist in the persecution of your\\nbrethren, who humble themselves and do walk after the holy order\\nof God, wherewith they have been brought into this church, having\\nbeen sanctified by the Holy Spirit, and they do bring forth works\\nwhich are meet for repentance--\\n\\nAlma 5:55\\n 55 Yea, and will you persist in turning your backs upon the\\npoor, and the needy, and in withholding your substance from them?\\n\\nAlma 5:56\\n 56 And finally, all ye that will persist in your wickedness, I\\nsay unto you that these are they who shall be hewn down and cast\\ninto the fire except they speedily repent.\\n\\nAlma 5:57\\n 57 And now I say unto you, all you that are desirous to follow\\nthe voice of the good shepherd, come ye out from the wicked, and\\nbe ye separate, and touch not their unclean things; and behold,\\ntheir names shall be blotted out, that the names of the wicked\\nshall not be numbered among the names of the righteous, that the\\nword of God may be fulfilled, which saith: The names of the\\nwicked shall not be mingled with the names of my people;\\n\\nAlma 5:58\\n 58 For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book\\nof life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right\\nhand.  And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this?  I\\nsay unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the\\nword of God must be fulfilled.\\n\\nAlma 5:59\\n 59 For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth\\nnot watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his\\nflock?  And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive\\nhim out?  Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.\\n\\nAlma 5:60\\n 60 And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after\\nyou; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you\\ninto his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that\\nye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nAlma 5:61\\n 61 And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who\\nhath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have\\nspoken unto you.\\n\\nAlma 5:62\\n 62 I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church;\\nand unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of\\ninvitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye\\nalso may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.\\n\\nAlma 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\nAlma 6:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of\\nspeaking unto the people of the church, which was established in\\nthe city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying\\non his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch\\nover the church.\\n\\nAlma 6:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the\\nchurch who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance,\\nand were received into the church.\\n\\nAlma 6:3\\n 3 And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the\\nchurch that did not repent of their wickedness and humble\\nthemselves before God--I mean those who were lifted up in the\\npride of their hearts--the same were rejected, and their names\\nwere blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those\\nof the righteous.\\n\\nAlma 6:4\\n 4 And thus they began to establish the order of the church in\\nthe city of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 6:5\\n 5 Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was\\nliberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of\\nassembling themselves together to hear the word of God.\\n\\nAlma 6:6\\n 6 Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they\\nshould gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and\\nmighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who\\nknew not God.\\n\\nAlma 6:7\\n 7 And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these\\nregulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was\\nin the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the\\nriver Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city\\nbuilt, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the\\nvalley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was\\nslain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.\\n\\nAlma 6:8\\n 8 And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the\\nchurch which was established in the valley of Gideon, according\\nto the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken\\nby his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was\\nin him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of\\nGod, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and\\nthe holy order by which he was called.  And thus it is written. \\nAmen.\\n\\nAlma 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\nAlma 7:1\\n 1 Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted\\nto come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my\\nlanguage; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time\\nthat I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having\\nbeen wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much\\nbusiness that I could not come unto you.\\n\\nAlma 7:2\\n 2 And even I could not have come now at this time were it not\\nthat the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my\\nstead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come\\nunto you.\\n\\nAlma 7:3\\n 3 And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire\\nthat I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and\\nthat ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I\\nshould find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find\\nthat ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in\\nat Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 7:4\\n 4 But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know,\\nyea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that\\nthey are established again in the way of his righteousness.\\n\\nAlma 7:5\\n 5 And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me,\\nthat I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire\\nthat my joy over you should come by the cause of so much\\nafflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at\\nZarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading\\nthrough much affliction and sorrow.\\n\\nAlma 7:6\\n 6 But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much\\nunbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up\\nin the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set\\nyour hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I\\ntrust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the\\ntrue and living God, and that ye look forward for the remission\\nof your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.\\n\\nAlma 7:7\\n 7 For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and\\nbehold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they\\nall--for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer\\nliveth and cometh among his people.\\n\\nAlma 7:8\\n 8 Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of\\nhis dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit\\nhath not said unto me that this should be the case.  Now as to\\nthis thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord\\nGod hath power to do all things which are according to his word.\\n\\nAlma 7:9\\n 9 But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying:\\nCry unto this people, saying--Repent ye, and prepare the way of\\nthe Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold,\\nthe kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon\\nthe face of the earth.\\n\\nAlma 7:10\\n 10 And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is\\nthe land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and\\nchosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the\\npower of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son\\nof God.\\n\\nAlma 7:11\\n 11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and\\ntemptations of every kind; and this that the word might be\\nfulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the\\nsicknesses of his people.\\n\\nAlma 7:12\\n 12 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands\\nof death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their\\ninfirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according\\nto the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to\\nsuccor his people according to their infirmities.\\n\\nAlma 7:13\\n 13 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of\\nGod suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him\\nthe sins of his people, that he might blot out their\\ntransgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now\\nbehold, this is the testimony which is in me.\\n\\nAlma 7:14\\n 14 Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again;\\nfor the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit\\nthe kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto\\nrepentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may\\nhave faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the\\nworld, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all\\nunrighteousness.\\n\\nAlma 7:15\\n 15 Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every\\nsin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to\\ndestruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that\\nye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant\\nwith him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this\\nday by going into the waters of baptism.\\n\\nAlma 7:16\\n 16 And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God\\nfrom thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him,\\nyea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have\\neternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit,\\nwhich testifieth in me.\\n\\nAlma 7:17\\n 17 And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things? \\nBehold, I say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the\\nway that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of\\nthe Spirit which is in me.  And now because your faith is strong\\nconcerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken,\\ngreat is my joy.\\n\\nAlma 7:18\\n 18 For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much\\ndesire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your\\nbrethren, even so I have found that my desires have been\\ngratified.\\n\\nAlma 7:19\\n 19 For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I\\nperceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of\\nGod; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.\\n\\nAlma 7:20\\n 20 I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the\\ntestimony of his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths;\\nneither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath\\nhe a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that\\nwhich is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is\\none eternal round.\\n\\nAlma 7:21\\n 21 And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can\\nfilthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the\\nkingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come,\\nyea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall\\nremain in his filthiness.\\n\\nAlma 7:22\\n 22 And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto\\nyou that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that\\nye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy\\norder of God, after which ye have been received.\\n\\nAlma 7:23\\n 23 And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive\\nand gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and\\nlong-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in\\nkeeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for\\nwhatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal;\\nalways returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do\\nreceive.\\n\\nAlma 7:24\\n 24 And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye\\nwill always abound in good works.\\n\\nAlma 7:25\\n 25 And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless,\\nthat ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac,\\nand Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the\\nworld began, having your garments spotless even as their garments\\nare spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.\\n\\nAlma 7:26\\n 26 And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto\\nyou according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul\\ndoth exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and\\nheed which ye have given unto my word.\\n\\nAlma 7:27\\n 27 And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your\\nhouses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that\\nyou possess, your women and your children, according to your\\nfaith and good works, from this time forth and forever.  And thus\\nI have spoken.  Amen.\\n\\nAlma 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\nAlma 8:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of\\nGideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things\\nwhich cannot be written, having established the order of the\\nchurch, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla,\\nyea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself\\nfrom the labors which he had performed.\\n\\nAlma 8:2\\n 2 And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over\\nthe people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 8:3\\n 3 And it came to pass in the commencement of the tenth year of\\nthe reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma\\ndeparted from thence and took his journey over into the land of\\nMelek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders\\nof the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 8:4\\n 4 And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek\\naccording to the holy order of God, by which he had been called;\\nand he began to teach the people throughout all the land of\\nMelek.\\n\\nAlma 8:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all\\nthe borders of the land which was by the wilderness side.  And\\nthey were baptized throughout all the land;\\n\\nAlma 8:6\\n 6 So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed\\nthence, and traveled three days' journey on the north of the land\\nof Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah.\\n\\nAlma 8:7\\n 7 Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their\\nlands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their\\nsmall villages, after the name of him who first possessed them;\\nand thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.\\n\\nAlma 8:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of\\nAmmonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.\\n\\nAlma 8:9\\n 9 Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people\\nof the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto\\nthe words of Alma.\\n\\nAlma 8:10\\n 10 Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with\\nGod in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the\\npeople who were in the city; that he would also grant that he\\nmight baptize them unto repentance.\\n\\nAlma 8:11\\n 11 Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him:\\nBehold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art\\nhigh priest over the church which thou hast established in many\\nparts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of\\nthy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.\\n\\nAlma 8:12\\n 12 And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know\\nthat thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the\\njudgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief\\njudge over us.\\n\\nAlma 8:13\\n 13 Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his\\nwords, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he\\nshould be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his\\njourney towards the city which was called Aaron.\\n\\nAlma 8:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither,\\nbeing weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation\\nand anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who\\nwere in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was\\nthus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord\\nappeared unto him, saying:\\n\\nAlma 8:15\\n 15 Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and\\nrejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been\\nfaithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which\\nthou receivedst thy first message from him.  Behold, I am he that\\ndelivered it unto you.\\n\\nAlma 8:16\\n 16 And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the\\ncity of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city;\\nyea, preach unto them.  Yea, say unto them, except they repent\\nthe Lord God will destroy them.\\n\\nAlma 8:17\\n 17 For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy\\nthe liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is\\ncontrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which\\nhe has given unto his people.\\n\\nAlma 8:18\\n 18 Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message\\nfrom the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of\\nAmmonihah.  And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the\\nway which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.\\n\\nAlma 8:19\\n 19 And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to\\na man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?\\n\\nAlma 8:20\\n 20 And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that\\nthou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an\\nangel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive.  Therefore, go with\\nme into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I\\nknow that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.\\n\\nAlma 8:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the man received him into his house;\\nand the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and\\nmeat and set before Alma.\\n\\nAlma 8:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and\\nhe blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.\\n\\nAlma 8:23\\n 23 And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I\\nam Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout\\nthe land.\\n\\nAlma 8:24\\n 24 And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God\\namong all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and\\nprophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me,\\nbut they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this\\nland forever.\\n\\nAlma 8:25\\n 25 But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again\\nand prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them\\nconcerning their iniquities.\\n\\nAlma 8:26\\n 26 And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in,\\nthou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many\\ndays.\\n\\nAlma 8:27\\n 27 And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to\\npreach unto the people.\\n\\nAlma 8:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in\\ntheir iniquities.\\n\\nAlma 8:29\\n 29 And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my\\nservant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people,\\nsaying--Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I\\nwill visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my\\nfierce anger away.\\n\\nAlma 8:30\\n 30 And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to\\ndeclare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the\\nHoly Ghost.\\n\\nAlma 8:31\\n 31 And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could\\nnot be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man\\ncould slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power\\nuntil they were bound in bands and cast into prison.  Now, this\\nwas done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.\\n\\nAlma 8:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach\\nand to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and\\npower which the Lord had given them.\\n\\nAlma 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\nAlma 9:1\\n 1 And again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should\\ntake Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or\\nthe people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as\\nI began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me,\\nsaying:\\n\\nAlma 9:2\\n 2 Who art thou?  Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony\\nof one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth\\nshould pass away?\\n\\nAlma 9:3\\n 3 Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they\\nknew not that the earth should pass away.\\n\\nAlma 9:4\\n 4 And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou\\nshouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one\\nday.\\n\\nAlma 9:5\\n 5 Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for\\nthey were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.\\n\\nAlma 9:6\\n 6 And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than\\none man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such\\ngreat and marvelous things?\\n\\nAlma 9:7\\n 7 And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold,\\nthey did not.  And I stood with boldness to declare unto them,\\nyea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:\\n\\nAlma 9:8\\n 8 Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye\\nforgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have\\nforgotten the commandments of God.\\n\\nAlma 9:9\\n 9 Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of\\nJerusalem by the hand of God?  Do ye not remember that they were\\nall led by him through the wilderness?\\n\\nAlma 9:10\\n 10 And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our\\nfathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them\\nfrom being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?\\n\\nAlma 9:11\\n 11 Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his\\nmercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably\\nhave been cut off from the face of the earth long before this\\nperiod of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless\\nmisery and woe.\\n\\nAlma 9:12\\n 12 Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent;\\nand except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of\\nGod.  But behold, this is not all--he has commanded you to\\nrepent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the\\nearth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce\\nanger he will not turn away.\\n\\nAlma 9:13\\n 13 Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto\\nLehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye\\nshall prosper in the land?  And again it is said that: Inasmuch\\nas ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the\\npresence of the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 9:14\\n 14 Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the\\nLamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been\\ncut off from the presence of the Lord.  Now we see that the word\\nof the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites\\nhave been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their\\ntransgressions in the land.\\n\\nAlma 9:15\\n 15 Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable\\nfor them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in\\nyour sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life\\nthan for you, except ye repent.\\n\\nAlma 9:16\\n 16 For there are many promises which are extended to the\\nLamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers\\nthat caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore\\nthe Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence\\nin the land.\\n\\nAlma 9:17\\n 17 And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in\\nhis word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of\\ntheir fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will\\nbe merciful unto all who call on his name.\\n\\nAlma 9:18\\n 18 But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your\\nwickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for\\nthe Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they\\nshall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited\\nwith utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce\\nanger of the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 9:19\\n 19 For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your\\niniquities, to destroy his people.  I say unto you, Nay; he would\\nrather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who\\nare called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they\\ncould fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much\\nlight and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their\\nGod;\\n\\nAlma 9:20\\n 20 Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the\\nLord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation,\\nkindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made\\nknown unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and\\nprayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to\\ncome;\\n\\nAlma 9:21\\n 21 Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed\\nwith angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the\\nLord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of\\nrevelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with\\ntongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy\\nGhost, and the gift of translation;\\n\\nAlma 9:22\\n 22 Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land\\nof Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from\\nfamine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every\\nkind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not\\nbe destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time,\\nand having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been\\nprospered until they are rich in all manner of things--\\n\\nAlma 9:23\\n 23 And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have\\nreceived so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should\\ntransgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do\\nhave, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they\\nshould fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable\\nfor the Lamanites than for them.\\n\\nAlma 9:24\\n 24 For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the\\nLamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has\\nnot the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye\\nwill rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from\\noff the face of the earth?\\n\\nAlma 9:25\\n 25 And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the\\nLord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring\\nunto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this\\npeople, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at\\nhand;\\n\\nAlma 9:26\\n 26 And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his\\nglory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of\\nthe Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience,\\nmercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people\\nand to answer their prayers.\\n\\nAlma 9:27\\n 27 And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized\\nunto repentance, through faith on his name.\\n\\nAlma 9:28\\n 28 Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at\\nhand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according\\nto that which they have been--if they have been righteous they\\nshall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power\\nand deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they\\nshall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power\\nand captivation of the devil.\\n\\nAlma 9:29\\n 29 Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the\\npeople.\\n\\nAlma 9:30\\n 30 And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye\\nought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are\\nmeet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly\\nhardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost\\nand a fallen people.\\n\\nAlma 9:31\\n 31 Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these\\nwords, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto\\nthem that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.\\n\\nAlma 9:32\\n 32 And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a\\nfallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their\\nhands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.\\n\\nAlma 9:33\\n 33 But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that\\nthey should take me at that time and cast me into prison.\\n\\nAlma 9:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and\\nbegan to preach unto them also.  And now the words of Amulek are\\nnot all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in\\nthis book.\\n\\nAlma 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\nAlma 10:1\\n 1 Now these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people\\nwho were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:\\n\\nAlma 10:2\\n 2 I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of\\nIshmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was the same\\nAminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of\\nthe temple, which was written by the finger of God.\\n\\nAlma 10:3\\n 3 And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of\\nLehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant\\nof Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by\\nthe hands of his brethren.\\n\\nAlma 10:4\\n 4 And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all\\nthose who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and\\nfriends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my\\nindustry.\\n\\nAlma 10:5\\n 5 Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the\\nways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power.  I said\\nI never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake,\\nfor I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power;\\nyea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.\\n\\nAlma 10:6\\n 6 Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many\\ntimes and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these\\nthings, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling\\nagainst God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth\\nday of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the\\nreign of the judges.\\n\\nAlma 10:7\\n 7 As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an\\nangel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to\\nthine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea,\\na holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many\\ndays because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered,\\nand thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he\\nshall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord\\nshall rest upon thee and thy house.\\n\\nAlma 10:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and\\nreturned towards my house.  And as I was going thither I found\\nthe man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy\\nhouse--and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto\\nyou concerning the things of God.\\n\\nAlma 10:9\\n 9 And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know\\nhe is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.\\n\\nAlma 10:10\\n 10 And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified\\nare true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth,\\neven so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto\\nme; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.\\n\\nAlma 10:11\\n 11 For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me,\\nand my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk;\\nyea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the\\nLord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.\\n\\nAlma 10:12\\n 12 And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began\\nto be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who\\ntestified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of\\nthe things which were to come, according to the spirit of\\nprophecy which was in them.\\n\\nAlma 10:13\\n 13 Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to\\nquestion them, that by their cunning devices they might catch\\nthem in their words, that they might find witness against them,\\nthat they might deliver them to their judges that they might be\\njudged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast\\ninto prison, according to the crime which they could make appear\\nor witness against them.\\n\\nAlma 10:14\\n 14 Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were\\nlawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer\\nthe law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes\\nof the people before the judges.\\n\\nAlma 10:15\\n 15 Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of\\nthe people; and this was to enable them that they might be\\nskilful in their profession.\\n\\nAlma 10:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that\\nthereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the\\nwords which he should speak.\\n\\nAlma 10:17\\n 17 Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. \\nBut it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived\\ntheir thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse\\ngeneration, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the\\nfoundation of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to\\ncatch the holy ones of God.\\n\\nAlma 10:18\\n 18 Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and\\nto bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter\\ndestruction of this people.\\n\\nAlma 10:19\\n 19 Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was\\nabout to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon,\\ncausing that this people should be governed by their own\\nvoices--yea, well did he say that if the time should come that\\nthe voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the\\ntime should come that this people should fall into transgression,\\nthey would be ripe for destruction.\\n\\nAlma 10:20\\n 20 And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your\\niniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of\\nhis angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at\\nhand.\\n\\nAlma 10:21\\n 21 Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I\\nwill come down among my people, with equity and justice in my\\nhands.\\n\\nAlma 10:22\\n 22 Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers\\nof the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now\\nbe visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood,\\nas were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by\\nfamine, and by pestilence, and the sword.\\n\\nAlma 10:23\\n 23 But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared;\\nnow therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you\\nthen will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he\\nwill come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine,\\nand by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand\\nexcept ye repent.\\n\\nAlma 10:24\\n 24 And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with\\nAmulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against\\nour laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have\\nselected.\\n\\nAlma 10:25\\n 25 But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier\\nunto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath\\nSatan got such great hold upon your hearts?  Why will ye yield\\nyourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind\\nyour eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are\\nspoken, according to their truth?\\n\\nAlma 10:26\\n 26 For behold, have I testified against your law?  Ye do not\\nunderstand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I\\nhave not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your\\ncondemnation.\\n\\nAlma 10:27\\n 27 And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the\\ndestruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the\\nunrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.\\n\\nAlma 10:28\\n 28 And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these\\nwords the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that\\nthis man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for\\nhe hath spoken against our law.  And now he says that he has not\\nspoken against it.\\n\\nAlma 10:29\\n 29 And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our\\njudges.\\n\\nAlma 10:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts\\nthat they should remember these things against him.\\n\\nAlma 10:31\\n 31 And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom.  Now he\\nwas the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the\\nmost expert among them, having much business to do among the\\npeople.\\n\\nAlma 10:32\\n 32 Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got\\ngain according to their employ.\\n\\nAlma 11\\nChapter 11\\n\\nAlma 11:1\\n 1 Now it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge\\nof the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should\\nreceive wages according to the time which they labored to judge\\nthose who were brought before them to be judged.\\n\\nAlma 11:2\\n 2 Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he\\ndid owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge\\nexecuted authority, and sent forth officers that the man should\\nbe brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law\\nand the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the\\nman was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or\\nbe cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.\\n\\nAlma 11:3\\n 3 And the judge received for his wages according to his time--a\\nsenine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to\\na senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was\\ngiven.\\n\\nAlma 11:4\\n 4 Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold,\\nand of their silver, according to their value.  And the names are\\ngiven by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner\\nof the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after\\nthe manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and\\ntheir measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of\\nthe people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges,\\nthey having been established by king Mosiah.\\n\\nAlma 11:5\\n 5 Now the reckoning is thus--a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a\\nshum of gold, and a limnah of gold.\\n\\nAlma 11:6\\n 6 A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and\\nan onti of silver.\\n\\nAlma 11:7\\n 7 A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either\\nfor a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of\\ngrain.\\n\\nAlma 11:8\\n 8 Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a\\nsenine.\\n\\nAlma 11:9\\n 9 And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.\\n\\nAlma 11:10\\n 10 And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.\\n\\nAlma 11:11\\n 11 And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.\\n\\nAlma 11:12\\n 12 And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.\\n\\nAlma 11:13\\n 13 And an onti was as great as them all.\\n\\nAlma 11:14\\n 14 Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their\\nreckoning--\\n\\nAlma 11:15\\n 15 A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a\\nmeasure of barley.\\n\\nAlma 11:16\\n 16 And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.\\n\\nAlma 11:17\\n 17 And a leah is the half of a shiblum.\\n\\nAlma 11:18\\n 18 Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.\\n\\nAlma 11:19\\n 19 Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.\\n\\nAlma 11:20\\n 20 Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they\\nreceived their wages according to their employ, therefore, they\\ndid stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of\\ndisturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ,\\nthat they might get money according to the suits which were\\nbrought before them; therefore they did stir up the people\\nagainst Alma and Amulek.\\n\\nAlma 11:21\\n 21 And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye\\nanswer me a few questions which I shall ask you?  Now Zeezrom was\\na man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might\\ndestroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will\\nye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?\\n\\nAlma 11:22\\n 22 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the\\nSpirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which\\nis contrary to the Spirit of the Lord.  And Zeezrom said unto\\nhim: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I\\ngive thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.\\n\\nAlma 11:23\\n 23 Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me? \\nKnowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?\\n\\nAlma 11:24\\n 24 Believest thou that there is no God?  I say unto you, Nay,\\nthou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more\\nthan him.\\n\\nAlma 11:25\\n 25 And now thou hast lied before God unto me.  Thou saidst unto\\nme--Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will\\ngive unto thee--when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them\\nfrom me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true\\nand living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me.  And\\nnow behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward.\\n\\nAlma 11:26\\n 26 And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and\\nliving God?\\n\\nAlma 11:27\\n 27 And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.\\n\\nAlma 11:28\\n 28 Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?\\n\\nAlma 11:29\\n 29 And he answered, No.\\n\\nAlma 11:30\\n 30 Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these\\nthings?\\n\\nAlma 11:31\\n 31 And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.\\n\\nAlma 11:32\\n 32 And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come?  Is it the\\nSon of God?\\n\\nAlma 11:33\\n 33 And he said unto him, Yea.\\n\\nAlma 11:34\\n 34 And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their\\nsins?  And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he\\nshall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.\\n\\nAlma 11:35\\n 35 Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these\\nthings; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the\\nSon of God shall come, but he shall not save his people--as\\nthough he had authority to command God.\\n\\nAlma 11:36\\n 36 Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for\\nthou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God\\nbecause I said he shall not save his people in their sins.\\n\\nAlma 11:37\\n 37 And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their\\nsins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no\\nunclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how\\ncan ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? \\nTherefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.\\n\\nAlma 11:38\\n 38 Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very\\nEternal Father?\\n\\nAlma 11:39\\n 39 And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father\\nof heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is\\nthe beginning and the end, the first and the last;\\n\\nAlma 11:40\\n 40 And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he\\nshall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on\\nhis name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and\\nsalvation cometh to none else.\\n\\nAlma 11:41\\n 41 Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no\\nredemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death;\\nfor behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and\\nstand before God, and be judged according to their works.\\n\\nAlma 11:42\\n 42 Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and\\nthe death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death,\\nthat all shall be raised from this temporal death.\\n\\nAlma 11:43\\n 43 The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its\\nperfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper\\nframe, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought\\nto stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a\\nbright recollection of all our guilt.\\n\\nAlma 11:44\\n 44 Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young,\\nboth bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the\\nrighteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their\\nheads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect\\nframe, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be\\narraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father,\\nand the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged\\naccording to their works, whether they be good or whether they be\\nevil.\\n\\nAlma 11:45\\n 45 Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of\\nthe mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the\\nmortal body.  I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to\\nan immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death\\nunto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with\\ntheir bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming\\nspiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.\\n\\nAlma 11:46\\n 46 Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began\\nagain to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble.  And\\nthus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have\\nwritten.\\n\\nAlma 12\\nChapter 12\\n\\nAlma 12:1\\n 1 Now Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced\\nZeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying\\nand deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble\\nunder a consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began\\nto speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to\\nexplain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that\\nwhich Amulek had done.\\n\\nAlma 12:2\\n 2 Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the\\npeople round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on\\nthis wise:\\n\\nAlma 12:3\\n 3 Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and\\ncraftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast\\nlied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou\\nseest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;\\n\\nAlma 12:4\\n 4 And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle\\nplan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive\\nthis people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us\\nand to cast us out--\\n\\nAlma 12:5\\n 5 Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised\\nhis power in thee.  Now I would that ye should remember that what\\nI say unto thee I say unto all.\\n\\nAlma 12:6\\n 6 And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the\\nadversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might\\nbring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you\\nabout with his chains, that he might chain you down to\\neverlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.\\n\\nAlma 12:7\\n 7 Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble\\nmore exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power\\nof God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a\\nknowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the\\nthoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them\\nthat they might know of these things according to the spirit of\\nprophecy.\\n\\nAlma 12:8\\n 8 And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might\\nknow more concerning the kingdom of God.  And he said unto Alma:\\nWhat does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the\\nresurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both\\nthe just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to\\nbe judged according to their works?\\n\\nAlma 12:9\\n 9 And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying:\\nIt is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless\\nthey are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart\\nonly according to the portion of his word which he doth grant\\nunto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence\\nwhich they give unto him.\\n\\nAlma 12:10\\n 10 And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same\\nreceiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not\\nharden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the\\nword, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God\\nuntil he know them in full.\\n\\nAlma 12:11\\n 11 And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the\\nlesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his\\nmysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led\\nby his will down to destruction.  Now this is what is meant by\\nthe chains of hell.\\n\\nAlma 12:12\\n 12 And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being\\nraised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being\\nbrought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our\\nworks.\\n\\nAlma 12:13\\n 13 Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have\\nhardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not\\nbeen found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall\\nbe condemned.\\n\\nAlma 12:14\\n 14 For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will\\ncondemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will\\nalso condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to\\nlook up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command\\nthe rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his\\npresence.\\n\\nAlma 12:15\\n 15 But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him\\nin his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and\\ndominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his\\njudgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he\\nis merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power\\nto save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth\\nfruit meet for repentance.\\n\\nAlma 12:16\\n 16 And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a\\nsecond death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that\\nwhosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also\\ndie a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining\\nunto righteousness.\\n\\nAlma 12:17\\n 17 Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of\\nfire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever;\\nand then is the time that they shall be chained down to an\\neverlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of\\nSatan, he having subjected them according to his will.\\n\\nAlma 12:18\\n 18 Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been\\nno redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to\\nGod's justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more\\ncorruption.\\n\\nAlma 12:19\\n 19 Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of\\nspeaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;\\n\\nAlma 12:20\\n 20 But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them,\\ncame forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said,\\nthat man should rise from the dead and be changed from this\\nmortal to an immortal state that the soul can never die?\\n\\nAlma 12:21\\n 21 What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed\\ncherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden,\\nlest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of\\nthe tree of life, and live forever?  And thus we see that there\\nwas no possible chance that they should live forever.\\n\\nAlma 12:22\\n 22 Now Alma said unto him:  This is the thing which I was about\\nto explain, now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the\\nforbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see,\\nthat by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.\\n\\nAlma 12:23\\n 23 And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible\\nfor Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at\\nthat time, there would have been no death, and the word would\\nhave been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou\\nshalt surely die.\\n\\nAlma 12:24\\n 24 And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death\\nwhich has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death;\\nnevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might\\nrepent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time\\nto prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state\\nwhich has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection\\nof the dead.\\n\\nAlma 12:25\\n 25 Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was\\nlaid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no\\nresurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption\\nlaid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of\\nwhich has been spoken.\\n\\nAlma 12:26\\n 26 And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents\\ncould have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would\\nhave been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and\\nthus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the\\nword of God would have been void, taking none effect.\\n\\nAlma 12:27\\n 27 But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that\\nthey must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even\\nthat same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.\\n\\nAlma 12:28\\n 28 And after God had appointed that these things should come\\nunto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man\\nshould know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto\\nthem;\\n\\nAlma 12:29\\n 29 Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused\\nmen to behold of his glory.\\n\\nAlma 12:30\\n 30 And they began from that time forth to call on his name;\\ntherefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the\\nplan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation\\nof the world; and this he made known unto them according to their\\nfaith and repentance and their holy works.\\n\\nAlma 12:31\\n 31 Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first\\ntransgressed the first commandments as to things which were\\ntemporal, and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing\\nthemselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act\\naccording to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to\\ndo good--\\n\\nAlma 12:32\\n 32 Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made\\nknown unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do\\nevil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an\\neverlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for\\non such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works\\nof justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme\\ngoodness of God.\\n\\nAlma 12:33\\n 33 But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being\\nthe plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent\\nand harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you,\\nthrough mine Only Begotten Son;\\n\\nAlma 12:34\\n 34 Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart,\\nhe shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto\\na remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.\\n\\nAlma 12:35\\n 35 And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity,\\nbehold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.\\n\\nAlma 12:36\\n 36 And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will\\nharden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord;\\ntherefore your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his\\nwrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according to his\\nword in the last provocation as well as the first, to the\\neverlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to\\nhis word, unto the last death, as well as the first.\\n\\nAlma 12:37\\n 37 And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they\\nare true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we\\nprovoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in\\nthese his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let\\nus enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according to his\\nword.\\n\\nAlma 13\\nChapter 13\\n\\nAlma 13:1\\n 1 And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the\\ntime when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children;\\nand I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained\\npriests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his\\nSon, to teach these things unto the people.\\n\\nAlma 13:2\\n 2 And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in\\na manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to\\nlook forward to his Son for redemption.\\n\\nAlma 13:3\\n 3 And this is the manner after which they were ordained--being\\ncalled and prepared from the foundation of the world according to\\nthe foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and\\ngood works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil;\\ntherefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly\\ngreat faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy\\ncalling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory\\nredemption for such.\\n\\nAlma 13:4\\n 4 And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account\\nof their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on\\naccount of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their\\nminds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as\\ngreat privilege as their brethren.\\n\\nAlma 13:5\\n 5 Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing\\nwith their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from\\nthe foundation of the world for such as would not harden their\\nhearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten\\nSon, who was prepared--\\n\\nAlma 13:6\\n 6 And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto\\nthe high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his\\ncommandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter\\ninto his rest--\\n\\nAlma 13:7\\n 7 This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which\\norder was from the foundation of the world; or in other words,\\nbeing without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared\\nfrom eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of\\nall things--\\n\\nAlma 13:8\\n 8 Now they were ordained after this manner--being called with a\\nholy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon\\nthem the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and\\nordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or end--\\n\\nAlma 13:9\\n 9 Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the\\nSon, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of\\ndays or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. \\nAnd thus it is.  Amen.\\n\\nAlma 13:10\\n 10 Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high\\npriesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high\\npriests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith\\nand repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing\\nto repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;\\n\\nAlma 13:11\\n 11 Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were\\nsanctified, and their garments were washed white through the\\nblood of the Lamb.\\n\\nAlma 13:12\\n 12 Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having\\ntheir garments made white, being pure and spotless before God,\\ncould not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there\\nwere many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered\\ninto the rest of the Lord their God.\\n\\nAlma 13:13\\n 13 And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble\\nyourselves before God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance,\\nthat ye may also enter into that rest.\\n\\nAlma 13:14\\n 14 Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of\\nMelchizedek, who was also a high priest after this same order\\nwhich I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood\\nforever.\\n\\nAlma 13:15\\n 15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes;\\nyea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all\\nhe possessed.\\n\\nAlma 13:16\\n 16 Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that\\nthereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being\\na type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they\\nmight look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that\\nthey might enter into the rest of the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 13:17\\n 17 Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and\\nhis people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea,\\nthey had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of\\nwickedness;\\n\\nAlma 13:18\\n 18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received\\nthe office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of\\nGod, did preach repentance unto his people.  And behold, they did\\nrepent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his\\ndays; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the\\nking of Salem; and he did reign under his father.\\n\\nAlma 13:19\\n 19 Now, there were many before him, and also there were many\\nafterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have\\nmore particularly made mention.\\n\\nAlma 13:20\\n 20 Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may\\nsuffice.  Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest\\nthem it shall be to your own destruction.\\n\\nAlma 13:21\\n 21 And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words\\nunto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a\\nmighty voice, saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of\\nsalvation draweth nigh;\\n\\nAlma 13:22\\n 22 Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth\\ndeclare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may\\nhave glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad\\ntidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are\\nscattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have\\ncome unto us.\\n\\nAlma 13:23\\n 23 And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may\\nunderstand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being\\nwanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly\\nfavored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all\\nparts of our vineyard.\\n\\nAlma 13:24\\n 24 For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in\\nour land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of\\nthe children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming\\nin his glory.\\n\\nAlma 13:25\\n 25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us\\nby the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we\\nknow not how soon.  Would to God that it might be in my day; but\\nlet it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.\\n\\nAlma 13:26\\n 26 And it shall be made known unto just and holy men, by the\\nmouth of angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our\\nfathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have\\nspoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of\\nprophecy which was in them.\\n\\nAlma 13:27\\n 27 And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my\\nheart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would\\nhearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not\\nprocrastinate the day of your repentance;\\n\\nAlma 13:28\\n 28 But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call\\non his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not\\nbe tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the\\nHoly Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of\\nlove and all long-suffering;\\n\\nAlma 13:29\\n 29 Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive\\neternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that\\nye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.\\n\\nAlma 13:30\\n 30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not\\nbring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by\\nthe chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.\\n\\nAlma 13:31\\n 31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not\\nwritten in this book.\\n\\nAlma 14\\nChapter 14\\n\\nAlma 14:1\\n 1 And it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto\\nthe people many of them did believe on his words, and began to\\nrepent, and to search the scriptures.\\n\\nAlma 14:2\\n 2 But the more part of them were desirous that they might\\ndestroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because\\nof the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said\\nthat Amulek had lied unto them, and had reviled against their law\\nand also against their lawyers and judges.\\n\\nAlma 14:3\\n 3 And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because\\nthey had testified so plainly against their wickedness, they\\nsought to put them away privily.\\n\\nAlma 14:4\\n 4 But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and\\nbound them with strong cords, and took them before the chief\\njudge of the land.\\n\\nAlma 14:5\\n 5 And the people went forth and witnessed against\\nthem--testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their\\nlawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that\\nwere in the land; and also testified that there was but one God,\\nand that he should send his Son among the people, but he should\\nnot save them; and many such things did the people testify\\nagainst Alma and Amulek.  Now this was done before the chief\\njudge of the land.\\n\\nAlma 14:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words\\nwhich had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness\\nof the minds, which he had caused among the people by his lying\\nwords; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness\\nof his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the\\npains of hell.\\n\\nAlma 14:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people,\\nsaying: Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before\\nGod.  And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but\\nthey reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil?\\n\\nAnd they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and\\nalso all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by\\nAlma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast\\nstones at them.\\n\\nAlma 14:8\\n 8 And they brought their wives and children together, and\\nwhosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of\\nGod they caused that they should be cast into the fire, and they\\nalso brought forth their records which contained the holy\\nscriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be\\nburned and destroyed by fire.\\n\\nAlma 14:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and\\ncarried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might\\nwitness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.\\n\\nAlma 14:10\\n 10 And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who\\nwere consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto\\nAlma: How can we witness this awful scene?  Therefore let us\\nstretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is\\nin us, and save them from the flames.\\n\\nAlma 14:11\\n 11 But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I\\nmust not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth\\nthem up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may\\ndo this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them,\\naccording to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments\\nwhich he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and\\nthe blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them,\\nyea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.\\n\\nAlma 14:12\\n 12 Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us\\nalso.\\n\\nAlma 14:13\\n 13 And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord.  But,\\nbehold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.\\n\\nAlma 14:14\\n 14 Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had\\nbeen cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which\\nwere cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and\\nstood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote\\nthem with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them: After\\nwhat ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that\\nthey shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?\\n\\nAlma 14:15\\n 15 Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had\\nbeen cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they\\nwere of thy faith.  And the judge smote them again upon their\\ncheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?\\n\\nAlma 14:16\\n 16 Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who\\nslew Gideon.\\n\\nAlma 14:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him\\nnothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the\\nofficers to be cast into prison.\\n\\nAlma 14:18\\n 18 And when they had been cast into prison three days, there\\ncame many lawyers, and judges, and priests, and teachers, who\\nwere of the profession of Nehor; and they came in unto the prison\\nto see them, and they questioned them about many words; but they\\nanswered them nothing.\\n\\nAlma 14:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and\\nsaid: Why do ye not answer the words of this people?  Know ye not\\nthat I have power to deliver you up unto the flames?  And he\\ncommanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.\\n\\nAlma 14:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways,\\nbut came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again\\non their cheeks.  And many came forth also, and smote them,\\nsaying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn\\nour law?  If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver\\nyourselves?\\n\\nAlma 14:21\\n 21 And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their\\nteeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we\\nlook when we are damned?\\n\\nAlma 14:22\\n 22 And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they\\nsay unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days.  And\\nthey did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and\\nwater that they might thirst; and they also did take from them\\ntheir clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with\\nstrong cords, and confined in prison.\\n\\nAlma 14:23\\n 23 And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many\\ndays, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, in the\\ntenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi)\\nthat the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their\\nteachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and\\nAmulek were bound with cords.\\n\\nAlma 14:24\\n 24 And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again,\\nand said unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver\\nyourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the\\nLord will destroy this people according to your words.\\n\\nAlma 14:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them,\\nsaying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had\\nspoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and\\nthey rose and stood upon their feet.\\n\\nAlma 14:26\\n 26 And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great\\nafflictions, O Lord?  O Lord, give us strength according to our\\nfaith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance.  And they broke\\nthe cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw\\nthis, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come\\nupon them.\\n\\nAlma 14:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they\\nfell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the\\nprison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison\\nwere rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief\\njudge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon\\nAlma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.\\n\\nAlma 14:28\\n 28 And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they\\nwere not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power,\\naccording to their faith which was in Christ.  And they\\nstraightway came forth out of the prison; and they were loosed\\nfrom their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and\\nevery soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and\\nAmulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.\\n\\nAlma 14:29\\n 29 Now the people having heard a great noise came running\\ntogether by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw\\nAlma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls\\nthereof had fallen to the earth, they were struck with great\\nfear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a\\ngoat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee\\nfrom the presence of Alma and Amulek.\\n\\nAlma 15\\nChapter 15\\n\\nAlma 15:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek were commanded to\\ndepart out of that city; and they departed, and came out even\\ninto the land of Sidom; and behold, there they found all the\\npeople who had departed out of the land of Ammonihah, who had\\nbeen cast out and stoned, because they believed in the words of\\nAlma.\\n\\nAlma 15:2\\n 2 And they related unto them all that had happened unto their\\nwives and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their\\npower of deliverance.\\n\\nAlma 15:3\\n 3 And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever,\\nwhich was caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account\\nof his wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no\\nmore; and he supposed that they had been slain because of his\\niniquity.  And this great sin, and his many other sins, did\\nharrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having\\nno deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning\\nheat.\\n\\nAlma 15:4\\n 4 Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of\\nSidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message\\nimmediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.\\n\\nAlma 15:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that they went immediately, obeying the\\nmessage which he had sent unto them; and they went in unto the\\nhouse unto Zeezrom; and they found him upon his bed, sick, being\\nvery low with a burning fever; and his mind also was exceedingly\\nsore because of his iniquities; and when he saw them he stretched\\nforth his hand, and besought them that they would heal him.\\n\\nAlma 15:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the\\nhand: Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?\\n\\nAlma 15:7\\n 7 And he answered and said: Yea, I believe all the words that\\nthou hast taught.\\n\\nAlma 15:8\\n 8 And Alma said: If thou believest in the redemption of Christ\\nthou canst be healed.\\n\\nAlma 15:9\\n 9 And he said: Yea, I believe according to thy words.\\n\\nAlma 15:10\\n 10 And then Alma cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord our God,\\nhave mercy on this man, and heal him according to his faith which\\nis in Christ.\\n\\nAlma 15:11\\n 11 And when Alma had said these words, Zeezrom leaped upon his\\nfeet, and began to walk; and this was done to the great\\nastonishment of all the people; and the knowledge of this went\\nforth throughout all the land of Sidom.\\n\\nAlma 15:12\\n 12 And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from\\nthat time forth to preach unto the people.\\n\\nAlma 15:13\\n 13 And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and\\nconsecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the\\nLord whosoever were desirous to be baptized.\\n\\nAlma 15:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that they were many; for they did flock\\nin from all the region round about Sidom, and were baptized.\\n\\nAlma 15:15\\n 15 But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they\\nyet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they\\nrepented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and\\nAmulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of Nehor,\\nand did not believe in the repentance of their sins.\\n\\nAlma 15:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having\\nforsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which\\nwere in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being\\nrejected by those who were once his friends and also by his\\nfather and his kindred;\\n\\nAlma 15:17\\n 17 Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom,\\nseeing a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as\\nto the pride of their hearts, and began to humble themselves\\nbefore God, and began to assemble themselves together at their\\nsanctuaries to worship God before the altar, watching and praying\\ncontinually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from\\ndeath, and from destruction--\\n\\nAlma 15:18\\n 18 Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore\\nhe took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took\\nhim to his own house, and did administer unto him in his\\ntribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 15:19\\n 19 And thus ended the tenth year of the reign of the judges over\\nthe people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 16\\nChapter 16\\n\\nAlma 16:1\\n 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi, on the fifth day of the second\\nmonth, there having been much peace in the land of Zarahemla,\\nthere having been no wars nor contentions for a certain number of\\nyears, even until the fifth day of the second month in the\\neleventh year, there was a cry of war heard throughout the land.\\n\\nAlma 16:2\\n 2 For behold, the armies of the Lamanites had come in upon the\\nwilderness side, into the borders of the land, even into the city\\nof Ammonihah, and began to slay the people and destroy the city.\\n\\nAlma 16:3\\n 3 And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a\\nsufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed\\nthe people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some\\naround the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 16:4\\n 4 Now it came to pass that the Nephites were desirous to obtain\\nthose who had been carried away captive into the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 16:5\\n 5 Therefore, he that had been appointed chief captain over the\\narmies of the Nephites, (and his name was Zoram, and he had two\\nsons, Lehi and Aha)--now Zoram and his two sons, knowing that\\nAlma was high priest over the church, and having heard that he\\nhad the spirit of prophecy, therefore they went unto him and\\ndesired of him to know whither the Lord would that they should go\\ninto the wilderness in search of their brethren, who had been\\ntaken captive by the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 16:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that Alma inquired of the Lord concerning\\nthe matter.  And Alma returned and said unto them: Behold, the\\nLamanites will cross the river Sidon in the south wilderness,\\naway up beyond the borders of the land of Manti.  And behold\\nthere shall ye meet them, on the east of the river Sidon, and\\nthere the Lord will deliver unto thee thy brethren who have been\\ntaken captive by the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 16:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that Zoram and his sons crossed over the\\nriver Sidon, with their armies, and marched away beyond the\\nborders of Manti into the south wilderness, which was on the east\\nside of the river Sidon.\\n\\nAlma 16:8\\n 8 And they came upon the armies of the Lamanites, and the\\nLamanites were scattered and driven into the wilderness; and they\\ntook their brethren who had been taken captive by the Lamanites,\\nand there was not one soul of them had been lost that were taken\\ncaptive.  And they were brought by their brethren to possess\\ntheir own lands.\\n\\nAlma 16:9\\n 9 And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites\\nhaving been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah\\nwere destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites was\\ndestroyed, and also their great city, which they said God could\\nnot destroy, because of its greatness.\\n\\nAlma 16:10\\n 10 But behold, in one day it was left desolate; and the\\ncarcasses were mangled by dogs and wild beasts of the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 16:11\\n 11 Nevertheless, after many days their dead bodies were heaped\\nup upon the face of the earth, and they were covered with a\\nshallow covering.  And now so great was the scent thereof that\\nthe people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for\\nmany years.  And it was called Desolation of Nehors; for they\\nwere of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands\\nremained desolate.\\n\\nAlma 16:12\\n 12 And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the\\nNephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges\\nover the people of Nephi.  And thus for three years did the\\npeople of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.\\n\\nAlma 16:13\\n 13 And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the\\npeople in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in\\ntheir synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews.\\n\\nAlma 16:14\\n 14 And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did\\nimpart the word of God, without any respect of persons,\\ncontinually.\\n\\nAlma 16:15\\n 15 And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who\\nhad been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all\\nthe land.  And the establishment of the church became general\\nthroughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the\\npeople of the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 16:16\\n 16 And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out\\nhis Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of\\nthe children of men, or to prepare their hearts to receive the\\nword which should be taught among them at the time of his\\ncoming--\\n\\nAlma 16:17\\n 17 That they might not be hardened against the word, that they\\nmight not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they\\nmight receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into\\nthe true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord\\ntheir God.\\n\\nAlma 16:18\\n 18 Now those priests who did go forth among the people did\\npreach against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and\\nstrifes, and malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing,\\nplundering, murdering, committing adultery, and all manner of\\nlasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be--\\n\\nAlma 16:19\\n 19 Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding\\nforth the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and\\nalso the resurrection of the dead.\\n\\nAlma 16:20\\n 20 And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where\\nthe Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would\\nappear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did\\nhear with great joy and gladness.\\n\\nAlma 16:21\\n 21 And now after the church had been established throughout all\\nthe land--having got the victory over the devil, and the word of\\nGod being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord\\npouring out his blessings upon the people--thus ended the\\nfourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of\\nNephi.\\n\\nAlma 17\\nChapter 17\\n\\nAlma 17:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the\\nland of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to\\nhis astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying\\ntowards the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 17:2\\n 2 Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel\\nfirst appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly\\nto see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were\\nstill his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in\\nthe knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound\\nunderstanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently,\\nthat they might know the word of God.\\n\\nAlma 17:3\\n 3 But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer,\\nand fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the\\nspirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with\\npower and authority of God.\\n\\nAlma 17:4\\n 4 And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of\\nfourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in\\nbringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of\\ntheir words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on\\nhis name and confess their sins before him.\\n\\nAlma 17:5\\n 5 Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their\\njourneyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much,\\nboth in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and\\nalso much labor in the spirit.\\n\\nAlma 17:6\\n 6 Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their\\nfather, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having refused\\nthe kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them,\\nand also this was the minds of the people;\\n\\nAlma 17:7\\n 7 Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and\\ntook their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their\\narrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might\\nprovide food for themselves while in the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 17:8\\n 8 And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers\\nwhich they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach\\nthe word of God unto the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 17:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the\\nwilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord\\nwould grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them,\\nand abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the\\nhands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the\\nLamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the\\nbaseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not\\ncorrect.\\n\\nAlma 17:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his\\nSpirit, and said unto them: Be comforted.  And they were\\ncomforted.\\n\\nAlma 17:11\\n 11 And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the\\nLamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be\\npatient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth\\ngood examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of\\nthee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.\\n\\nAlma 17:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah,\\nand also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto\\nthe Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.\\n\\nAlma 17:13\\n 13 And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of\\nthe land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and\\ndeparted one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should\\nmeet again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that\\ngreat was the work which they had undertaken.\\n\\nAlma 17:14\\n 14 And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach\\nthe word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people;\\na people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and\\nplundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon\\ngold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain\\nthese things by murdering and plundering, that they might not\\nlabor for them with their own hands.\\n\\nAlma 17:15\\n 15 Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did\\nworship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because\\nof the traditions of their fathers; notwithstanding the promises\\nof the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of\\nrepentance.\\n\\nAlma 17:16\\n 16 Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah\\nhad undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto\\nrepentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the\\nplan of redemption.\\n\\nAlma 17:17\\n 17 Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and\\nwent forth among them, every man alone, according to the word and\\npower of God which was given unto him.\\n\\nAlma 17:18\\n 18 Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did\\nadminister unto them, and he departed from them, after having\\nblessed them according to their several stations, having imparted\\nthe word of God unto them, or administered unto them before his\\ndeparture; and thus they took their several journeys throughout\\nthe land.\\n\\nAlma 17:19\\n 19 And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called\\nafter the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 17:20\\n 20 And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took\\nhim and bound him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites\\nwho fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and\\nthus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to\\nretain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast\\nthem out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.\\n\\nAlma 17:21\\n 21 And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the\\nland of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant\\nof Ishmael.\\n\\nAlma 17:22\\n 22 And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell\\nin the land among the Lamanites, or among his people.\\n\\nAlma 17:23\\n 23 And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this\\npeople for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.\\n\\nAlma 17:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with\\nAmmon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would\\nthat Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife.\\n\\nAlma 17:25\\n 25 But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. \\nTherefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni.  And it came to\\npass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of\\nLamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 17:26\\n 26 And after he had been in the service of the king three days,\\nas he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their\\nflocks to the place of water, which was called the water of\\nSebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they\\nmay have water--\\n\\nAlma 17:27\\n 27 Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving\\nforth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain\\nnumber of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water,\\nstood and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the\\nking, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.\\n\\nAlma 17:28\\n 28 Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the\\nking will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks\\nwere scattered by the wickedness of these men.  And they began to\\nweep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered\\nalready.\\n\\nAlma 17:29\\n 29 Now they wept because of the fear of being slain.  Now when\\nAmmon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for,\\nsaid he, I will show forth my power unto these my\\nfellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these\\nflocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my\\nfellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words.\\n\\nAlma 17:30\\n 30 And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the\\nafflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.\\n\\nAlma 17:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words,\\nsaying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of\\nthe flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back\\nunto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks\\nunto the king and he will not slay us.\\n\\nAlma 17:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks,\\nand they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much\\nswiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather\\nthem together again to the place of water.\\n\\nAlma 17:33\\n 33 And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon\\nsaid unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they\\nflee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our\\nflocks.\\n\\nAlma 17:34\\n 34 Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went\\nforth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of\\nSebus; and they were in number not a few.\\n\\nAlma 17:35\\n 35 Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one\\nof their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they\\nknew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver\\nhis sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything\\nconcerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in the destruction\\nof their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the\\nflocks of the king.\\n\\nAlma 17:36\\n 36 But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with\\nhis sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst\\nthem; and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch that\\nthey began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were\\nangry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were\\ndetermined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they could\\nnot hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay\\nhim.\\n\\nAlma 17:37\\n 37 But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he\\nsmote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their\\nblows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch\\nthat they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him;\\nyea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee\\nby the strength of his arm.\\n\\nAlma 17:38\\n 38 Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none\\nsave it were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as\\nmany of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not\\na few.\\n\\nAlma 17:39\\n 39 And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they\\nwatered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the\\nking, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had\\nbeen smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to\\nslay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony\\nof the things which they had done.\\n\\nAlma 18\\nChapter 18\\n\\nAlma 18:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants\\nshould stand forth and testify to all the things which they had\\nseen concerning the matter.\\n\\nAlma 18:2\\n 2 And when they had all testified to the things which they had\\nseen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in\\npreserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending\\nagainst those who sought to slay him, he was astonished\\nexceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man.  Behold,\\nis not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments\\nupon this people, because of their murders?\\n\\nAlma 18:3\\n 3 And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great\\nSpirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he\\ncannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they\\nscatter the king's flocks when he is with us, because of his\\nexpertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a\\nfriend to the king.  And now, O king, we do not believe that a\\nman has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.\\n\\nAlma 18:4\\n 4 And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them:\\nNow I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at\\nthis time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I\\ndid your brethren.  Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our\\nfathers have spoken.\\n\\nAlma 18:5\\n 5 Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received\\nfrom his father, that there was a Great Spirit.  Notwithstanding\\nthey believed in a Great Spirit they supposed that whatsoever\\nthey did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear\\nexceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his\\nservants;\\n\\nAlma 18:6\\n 6 For he had slain many of them because their brethren had\\nscattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because\\nthey had had their flocks scattered they were slain.\\n\\nAlma 18:7\\n 7 Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the\\nwaters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby\\nthey might drive away many that were scattered unto their own\\nland, it being a practice of plunder among them.\\n\\nAlma 18:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants,\\nsaying: Where is this man that has such great power?\\n\\nAlma 18:9\\n 9 And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses.  Now\\nthe king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the\\nwatering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and\\nchariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there\\nhad been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the\\nfather of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.\\n\\nAlma 18:10\\n 10 Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his\\nhorses and his chariots he was more astonished, because of the\\nfaithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any\\nservant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this\\nman; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 18:11\\n 11 Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would\\ndesire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.\\n\\nAlma 18:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses\\nand the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto\\nthe king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was\\nchanged; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.\\n\\nAlma 18:13\\n 13 And one of the king's servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which\\nis, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their\\nkings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the\\nking desireth thee to stay.\\n\\nAlma 18:14\\n 14 Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto\\nhim: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king?  And the\\nking answered him not for the space of an hour, according to\\ntheir time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.\\n\\nAlma 18:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What\\ndesirest thou of me?  But the king answered him not.\\n\\nAlma 18:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the Spirit\\nof God, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king.  And he\\nsaid unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy\\nservants and thy flocks, and slew seven of their brethren with\\nthe sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others,\\nin order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it\\nthis that causeth thy marvelings?\\n\\nAlma 18:17\\n 17 I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great?\\n\\nBehold, I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever\\nthou desirest which is right, that will I do.\\n\\nAlma 18:18\\n 18 Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again,\\nfor he beheld that Ammon could discern his thoughts; but\\nnotwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said\\nunto him: Who art thou?  Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows\\nall things?\\n\\nAlma 18:19\\n 19 Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.\\n\\nAlma 18:20\\n 20 And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart?\\n\\nThou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things;\\nand also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of\\nmy brethren that scattered my flocks--\\n\\nAlma 18:21\\n 21 And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things,\\nwhatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were\\nneeded, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou\\nart more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou\\ndesirest of me I will grant it unto thee.\\n\\nAlma 18:22\\n 22 Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt\\nthou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do\\nthese things?  And this is the thing that I desire of thee.\\n\\nAlma 18:23\\n 23 And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all\\nthy words.  And thus he was caught with guile.\\n\\nAlma 18:24\\n 24 And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said\\nunto him: Believest thou that there is a God?\\n\\nAlma 18:25\\n 25 And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that\\nmeaneth.\\n\\nAlma 18:26\\n 26 And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great\\nSpirit?\\n\\nAlma 18:27\\n 27 And he said, Yea.\\n\\nAlma 18:28\\n 28 And Ammon said: This is God.  And Ammon said unto him again:\\nBelievest thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all\\nthings which are in heaven and in the earth?\\n\\nAlma 18:29\\n 29 And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which\\nare in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.\\n\\nAlma 18:30\\n 30 And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God\\ndwells and all his holy angels.\\n\\nAlma 18:31\\n 31 And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?\\n\\nAlma 18:32\\n 32 And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the\\nchildren of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the\\nheart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning.\\n\\nAlma 18:33\\n 33 And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou\\nhast spoken.  Art thou sent from God?\\n\\nAlma 18:34\\n 34 Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was\\ncreated after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy\\nSpirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be\\nbrought to a knowledge of that which is just and true;\\n\\nAlma 18:35\\n 35 And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me\\nknowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which\\nare in God.\\n\\nAlma 18:36\\n 36 Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation\\nof the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the\\nthings concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before\\nhim the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had\\nbeen spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their\\nfather, Lehi, left Jerusalem.\\n\\nAlma 18:37\\n 37 And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and\\nto his servants) all the journeyings of their fathers in the\\nwilderness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and\\ntheir travail, and so forth.\\n\\nAlma 18:38\\n 38 And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of\\nLaman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all their\\nrebellions did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them\\nall the records and scriptures from the time that Lehi left\\nJerusalem down to the present time.\\n\\nAlma 18:39\\n 39 But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of\\nredemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world;\\nand he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ,\\nand all the works of the Lord did he make known unto them.\\n\\nAlma 18:40\\n 40 And it came to pass that after he had said all these things,\\nand expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his\\nwords.\\n\\nAlma 18:41\\n 41 And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have\\nmercy; according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon\\nthe people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.\\n\\nAlma 18:42\\n 42 And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if\\nhe were dead.\\n\\nAlma 18:43\\n 43 And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried\\nhim in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if\\nhe were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his\\nwife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the\\nmanner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his loss.\\n\\nAlma 19\\nChapter 19\\n\\nAlma 19:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that after two days and two nights they\\nwere about to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, which they\\nhad made for the purpose of burying their dead.\\n\\nAlma 19:2\\n 2 Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she\\nsent and desired that he should come in unto her.\\n\\nAlma 19:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and\\nwent in unto the queen, and desired to know what she would that\\nhe should do.\\n\\nAlma 19:4\\n 4 And she said unto him: The servants of my husband have made it\\nknown unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that\\nthou hast power to do many mighty works in his name;\\n\\nAlma 19:5\\n 5 Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in\\nand see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the\\nspace of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not\\ndead, but others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and\\nthat he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself,\\nto me he doth not stink.\\n\\nAlma 19:6\\n 6 Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni\\nwas under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of\\nunbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which\\ndid light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God,\\nwhich was a marvelous light of his goodness--yea, this light had\\ninfused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been\\ndispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in\\nhis soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame,\\nand he was carried away in God--\\n\\nAlma 19:7\\n 7 Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his only desire. \\nTherefore, he went in to see the king according as the queen had\\ndesired him; and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not\\ndead.\\n\\nAlma 19:8\\n 8 And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in\\nGod, and on the morrow he shall rise again; therefore bury him\\nnot.\\n\\nAlma 19:9\\n 9 And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this?  And she said\\nunto him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of\\nour servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according\\nas thou hast said.\\n\\nAlma 19:10\\n 10 And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy\\nexceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such\\ngreat faith among all the people of the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 19:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her\\nhusband, from that time even until that time on the morrow which\\nAmmon had appointed that he should rise.\\n\\nAlma 19:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of\\nAmmon; and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the\\nwoman, and said: Blessed be the name of God, and blessed art\\nthou.\\n\\nAlma 19:13\\n 13 For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer;\\nand he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall\\nredeem all mankind who believe on his name.  Now, when he had\\nsaid these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk\\nagain with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered\\nby the Spirit.\\n\\nAlma 19:14\\n 14 Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according\\nto his prayers upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the\\ncause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all the\\npeople of God because of their iniquities and their traditions,\\nhe fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer\\nand thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his brethren;\\nand he was also overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had\\nsunk to the earth.\\n\\nAlma 19:15\\n 15 Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had\\nfallen, they also began to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord\\nhad come upon them also, for it was they who had stood before the\\nking and testified unto him concerning the great power of Ammon.\\n\\nAlma 19:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the\\nLord, in their might, even until they had all fallen to the\\nearth, save it were one of the Lamanitish women, whose name was\\nAbish, she having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on\\naccount of a remarkable vision of her father--\\n\\nAlma 19:17\\n 17 Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having\\nmade it known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of\\nLamoni had fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen,\\nand the king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she knew\\nthat it was the power of God; and supposing that this\\nopportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened\\namong them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to\\nbelieve in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house\\nto house, making it known unto the people.\\n\\nAlma 19:18\\n 18 And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house\\nof the king.  And there came a multitude, and to their\\nastonishment they beheld the king, and the queen, and their\\nservants prostrate upon the earth, and they all lay there as\\nthough they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold, he\\nwas a Nephite.\\n\\nAlma 19:19\\n 19 And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some\\nsaying that it was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon\\nthe king and his house, because he had suffered that the Nephite\\nshould remain in the land.\\n\\nAlma 19:20\\n 20 But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath brought this\\nevil upon his house, because he slew his servants who had had\\ntheir flocks scattered at the waters of Sebus.\\n\\nAlma 19:21\\n 21 And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the\\nwaters of Sebus and scattered the flocks which belonged to the\\nking, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which\\nhe had slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while\\ndefending the flocks of the king.\\n\\nAlma 19:22\\n 22 Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain with the sword\\nof Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and\\nwent forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and\\nas he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead.\\n\\nAlma 19:23\\n 23 Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the Lord had\\nsaid unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be\\nunto him according to thy faith--therefore, Mosiah trusted him\\nunto the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 19:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the\\nman had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear\\ncame upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to\\ntouch him or any of those who had fallen; and they began to\\nmarvel again among themselves what could be the cause of this\\ngreat power, or what all these things could mean.\\n\\nAlma 19:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that there were many among them who said\\nthat Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by\\nthe Great Spirit;\\n\\nAlma 19:26\\n 26 But others rebuked them all, saying that he was a monster,\\nwho had been sent from the Nephites to torment them.\\n\\nAlma 19:27\\n 27 And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great\\nSpirit to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it\\nwas the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who\\nhad ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it\\nwas this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their\\nbrethren, the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 19:28\\n 28 And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among\\nthem.  And while they were thus contending, the woman servant who\\nhad caused the multitude to be gathered together came, and when\\nshe saw the contention which was among the multitude she was\\nexceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears.\\n\\nAlma 19:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the\\nhand, that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as\\nsoon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet,\\nand cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has\\nsaved me from an awful hell!  O blessed God, have mercy on this\\npeople!\\n\\nAlma 19:30\\n 30 And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, being\\nfilled with joy, speaking many words which were not understood;\\nand when she had done this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the\\nhand, and behold he arose and stood upon his feet.\\n\\nAlma 19:31\\n 31 And he, immediately, seeing the contention among his people,\\nwent forth and began to rebuke them, and to teach them the words\\nwhich he had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard\\nhis words believed, and were converted unto the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 19:32\\n 32 But there were many among them who would not hear his words;\\ntherefore they went their way.\\n\\nAlma 19:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also\\nadministered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni;\\nand they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing--that\\ntheir hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do\\nevil.\\n\\nAlma 19:34\\n 34 And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had\\nseen angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told\\nthem things of God, and of his righteousness.\\n\\nAlma 19:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in\\ntheir words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they\\nbecame a righteous people, and they did establish a church among\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 19:36\\n 36 And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the\\nLamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon\\nthem; and we see that his arm is extended to all people who will\\nrepent and believe on his name.\\n\\nAlma 20\\nChapter 20\\n\\nAlma 20:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that when they had established a church in\\nthat land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him\\nto the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.\\n\\nAlma 20:2\\n 2 And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon saying: Thou shalt not\\ngo up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy\\nlife; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy\\nbrother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.\\n\\nAlma 20:3\\n 3 Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said\\nunto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at\\nMiddoni, and I go that I may deliver them.\\n\\nAlma 20:4\\n 4 Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the\\nLord thou canst do all things.  But behold, I will go with thee\\nto the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni,\\nwhose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to\\nthe land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and\\nhe will cast thy brethren out of prison.  Now Lamoni said unto\\nhim: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?\\n\\nAlma 20:5\\n 5 And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God;\\nand he said unto me--Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in\\nprison in the land of Middoni.\\n\\nAlma 20:6\\n 6 Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants\\nshould make ready his horses and his chariots.\\n\\nAlma 20:7\\n 7 And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the\\nland of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he\\nwill cast thy brethren out of prison.\\n\\nAlma 20:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying\\nthither, they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the\\nland.\\n\\nAlma 20:9\\n 9 And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not\\ncome to the feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my\\nsons, and unto my people?\\n\\nAlma 20:10\\n 10 And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite,\\nwho is one of the children of a liar?\\n\\nAlma 20:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he\\nwas going, for he feared to offend him.\\n\\nAlma 20:12\\n 12 And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own\\nkingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he\\nhad prepared.\\n\\nAlma 20:13\\n 13 And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things,\\nbehold, to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and\\nsaid: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are\\nsons of a liar.  Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his\\nchildren are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning\\nand their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our\\nproperty.\\n\\nAlma 20:14\\n 14 Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay\\nAmmon with the sword.  And he also commanded him that he should\\nnot go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him\\nto the land of Ishmael.\\n\\nAlma 20:15\\n 15 But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will\\nI return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni\\nthat I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they\\nare just men and holy prophets of the true God.\\n\\nAlma 20:16\\n 16 Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with\\nhim, and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.\\n\\nAlma 20:17\\n 17 But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt\\nnot slay thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he should\\nfall than thee, for behold, he has repented of his sins; but if\\nthou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could\\nnot be saved.\\n\\nAlma 20:18\\n 18 And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if\\nthou shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood\\nwould cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to\\ncome upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.\\n\\nAlma 20:19\\n 19 Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered\\nhim, saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should\\nshed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy\\nhim.\\n\\nAlma 20:20\\n 20 And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon.  But Ammon\\nwithstood his blows, and also smote his arm that he could not use\\nit.\\n\\nAlma 20:21\\n 21 Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to\\nplead with Ammon that he would spare his life.\\n\\nAlma 20:22\\n 22 But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will\\nsmite thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be\\ncast out of prison.\\n\\nAlma 20:23\\n 23 Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou\\nwilt spare me I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask,\\neven to half of the kingdom.\\n\\nAlma 20:24\\n 24 Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king\\naccording to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant\\nthat my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni\\nmay retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him,\\nbut grant that he may do according to his own desires in\\nwhatsoever thing he thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I\\nwill smite thee to the earth.\\n\\nAlma 20:25\\n 25 Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to\\nrejoice because of his life.\\n\\nAlma 20:26\\n 26 And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and\\nwhen he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was\\nastonished exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou\\nhast desired, that I would release thy brethren, and suffer that\\nmy son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant\\nunto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and\\nforever; and I will govern him no more--\\n\\nAlma 20:27\\n 27 And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast\\nout of prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my\\nkingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee.  For the king\\nwas greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also\\nat the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore\\nhe was desirous to learn them.\\n\\nAlma 20:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their\\njourney towards the land of Middoni.  And Lamoni found favor in\\nthe eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon\\nwere brought forth out of prison.\\n\\nAlma 20:29\\n 29 And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful,\\nfor behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly\\nbecause of being bound with strong cords.  And they also had\\nsuffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions;\\nnevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.\\n\\nAlma 20:30\\n 30 And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the\\nhands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore\\nthey would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them\\nout, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to\\nhouse, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in\\nthe land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into\\nprison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many\\ndays, and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.\\n\\nAlma 21\\nChapter 21\\n\\nAlma 21:1\\n 1 Now when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the\\nborders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his\\njourney towards the land which was called by the Lamanites,\\nJerusalem, calling it after the land of their fathers' nativity;\\nand it was away joining the borders of Mormon.\\n\\nAlma 21:2\\n 2 Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon\\nhad built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.\\n\\nAlma 21:3\\n 3 Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened,\\nbut the Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder;\\ntherefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden\\ntheir hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their\\nabominations.\\n\\nAlma 21:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem,\\nand first began to preach to the Amalekites.  And he began to\\npreach to them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues\\nafter the order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the\\nAmulonites were after the order of the Nehors.\\n\\nAlma 21:5\\n 5 Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to\\npreach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold\\nthere arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying:\\nWhat is that thou hast testified?  Hast thou seen an angel?  Why\\ndo not angels appear unto us?  Behold are not this people as good\\nas thy people?\\n\\nAlma 21:6\\n 6 Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish.  How\\nknowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts?  How knowest\\nthou that we have cause to repent?  How knowest thou that we are\\nnot a righteous people?  Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and\\nwe do assemble ourselves together to worship God.  We do believe\\nthat God will save all men.\\n\\nAlma 21:7\\n 7 Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God\\nshall come to redeem mankind from their sins?\\n\\nAlma 21:8\\n 8 And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest\\nany such thing.  We do not believe in these foolish traditions. \\nWe do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do\\nwe believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know\\nconcerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.\\n\\nAlma 21:9\\n 9 Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning\\nthe coming of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the\\ndead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind save it\\nwere through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the\\natonement of his blood.\\n\\nAlma 21:10\\n 10 And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto\\nthem they were angry with him, and began to mock him; and they\\nwould not hear the words which he spake.\\n\\nAlma 21:11\\n 11 Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he\\ndeparted out of their synagogue, and came over to a village which\\nwas called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word\\nunto them; and also Ammah and his brethren.  And they contended\\nwith many about the word.\\n\\nAlma 21:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that they saw that the people would\\nharden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into\\nthe land of Middoni.  And they did preach the word unto many, and\\nfew believed on the words which they taught.\\n\\nAlma 21:13\\n 13 Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were\\ntaken and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of\\nthe land of Middoni unto the regions round about.\\n\\nAlma 21:14\\n 14 And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and\\nthey were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they\\nwere fed and clothed.\\n\\nAlma 21:15\\n 15 And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they\\nwere delivered for the first time out of prison; and thus they\\nhad suffered.\\n\\nAlma 21:16\\n 16 And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit\\nof the Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the\\nAmalekites, or in every assembly of the Lamanites where they\\ncould be admitted.\\n\\nAlma 21:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that the Lord began to bless them,\\ninsomuch that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth;\\nyea, they did convince many of their sins, and of the traditions\\nof their fathers, which were not correct.\\n\\nAlma 21:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the\\nland of Middoni to the land of Ishmael, which was the land of\\ntheir inheritance.\\n\\nAlma 21:19\\n 19 And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve him,\\nor be his servant.\\n\\nAlma 21:20\\n 20 But he caused that there should be synagogues built in the\\nland of Ishmael; and he caused that his people, or the people who\\nwere under his reign, should assemble themselves together.\\n\\nAlma 21:21\\n 21 And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many\\nthings.  And he did also declare unto them that they were a\\npeople who were under him, and that they were a free people, that\\nthey were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for\\nthat his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the\\npeople who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round\\nabout.\\n\\nAlma 21:22\\n 22 And he also declared unto them that they might have the\\nliberty of worshiping the Lord their God according to their\\ndesires, in whatsoever place they were in, if it were in the land\\nwhich was under the reign of king Lamoni.\\n\\nAlma 21:23\\n 23 And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it\\ncame to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things\\npertaining to righteousness.  And he did exhort them daily, with\\nall diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were\\nzealous for keeping the commandments of God.\\n\\nAlma 22\\nChapter 22\\n\\nAlma 22:1\\n 1 Now, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni\\ncontinually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his\\nbrethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was\\nled by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the\\nking which was over all the land save it were the land of\\nIshmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.\\n\\nAlma 22:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king's\\npalace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and\\nsaid unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom\\nthou hast delivered out of prison.\\n\\nAlma 22:3\\n 3 And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy\\nservants.  And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant\\nunto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my\\nservants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for\\nI have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity\\nand the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire\\nto know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with\\nthee.\\n\\nAlma 22:4\\n 4 And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord\\nhas called him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael,\\nto teach the people of Lamoni.\\n\\nAlma 22:5\\n 5 Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said\\nconcerning the Spirit of the Lord?  Behold, this is the thing\\nwhich doth trouble me.\\n\\nAlma 22:6\\n 6 And also, what is this that Ammon said--If ye will repent ye\\nshall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off\\nat the last day?\\n\\nAlma 22:7\\n 7 And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that\\nthere is a God?  And the king said: I know that the Amalekites\\nsay that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they\\nshould build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves\\ntogether to worship him.  And if now thou sayest there is a God,\\nbehold I will believe.\\n\\nAlma 22:8\\n 8 And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and\\nhe said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a\\nGod.\\n\\nAlma 22:9\\n 9 And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our\\nfathers out of the land of Jerusalem?\\n\\nAlma 22:10\\n 10 And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he\\ncreated all things both in heaven and in earth.  Believest thou\\nthis?\\n\\nAlma 22:11\\n 11 And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all\\nthings, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these\\nthings, and I will believe thy words.\\n\\nAlma 22:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would\\nbelieve his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading\\nthe scriptures unto the king--how God created man after his own\\nimage, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of\\ntransgression, man had fallen.\\n\\nAlma 22:13\\n 13 And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the\\ncreation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their\\ncarnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared\\nfrom the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all\\nwhosoever would believe on his name.\\n\\nAlma 22:14\\n 14 And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of\\nhimself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their\\nsins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he\\nbreaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no\\nvictory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in\\nthe hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto\\nthe king.\\n\\nAlma 22:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these\\nthings unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have\\nthis eternal life of which thou hast spoken?  Yea, what shall I\\ndo that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted\\nout of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled\\nwith joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day?  Behold,\\nsaid he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake\\nmy kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.\\n\\nAlma 22:16\\n 16 But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou\\nwilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy\\nsins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in\\nfaith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive\\nthe hope which thou desirest.\\n\\nAlma 22:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the\\nking did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he\\ndid prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:\\n\\nAlma 22:18\\n 18 O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there\\nis a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto\\nme, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may\\nbe raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day.  And now\\nwhen the king had said these words, he was struck as if he were\\ndead.\\n\\nAlma 22:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen\\nall that had happened unto the king.  And she came in unto the\\nking; and when she saw him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron\\nand his brethren standing as though they had been the cause of\\nhis fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her\\nservants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 22:20\\n 20 Now the servants had seen the cause of the king's fall,\\ntherefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his\\nbrethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest\\nthou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is\\nmightier than us all?  Therefore we shall fall before them.\\n\\nAlma 22:21\\n 21 Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also\\nbegan to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon\\nher.  And she commanded her servants that they should go and call\\nthe people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.\\n\\nAlma 22:22\\n 22 Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also\\nknowing the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest\\nthat a multitude should assemble themselves together, and there\\nshould be a great contention and a disturbance among them;\\ntherefore he put forth his hand and raised the king from the\\nearth, and said unto him: Stand.  And he stood upon his feet,\\nreceiving his strength.\\n\\nAlma 22:23\\n 23 Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of\\nthe servants.  And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and\\nbegan to fear.  And the king stood forth, and began to minister\\nunto them.  And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his\\nwhole household were converted unto the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 22:24\\n 24 Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the\\ncommandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings\\namong them because of Aaron and his brethren.\\n\\nAlma 22:25\\n 25 But the king stood forth among them and administered unto\\nthem.  And they were pacified towards Aaron and those who were\\nwith him.\\n\\nAlma 22:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people\\nwere pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand\\nforth in the midst of the multitude, and that they should preach\\nthe word unto them.\\n\\nAlma 22:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation\\nthroughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all\\nhis land, who were in all the regions round about, which was\\nbordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which\\nwas divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of\\nwilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and\\nround about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of\\nthe wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla,\\nthrough the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon,\\nrunning from the east towards the west--and thus were the\\nLamanites and the Nephites divided.\\n\\nAlma 22:28\\n 28 Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived in the\\nwilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the\\nwilderness on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on\\nthe west of the land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the\\nseashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of\\ntheir fathers' first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the\\nseashore.\\n\\nAlma 22:29\\n 29 And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the\\nseashore, whither the Nephites had driven them.  And thus the\\nNephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless\\nthe Nephites had taken possession of all the northern parts of\\nthe land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river\\nSidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness\\nside; on the north, even until they came to the land which they\\ncalled Bountiful.\\n\\nAlma 22:30\\n 30 And it bordered upon the land which they called Desolation,\\nit being so far northward that it came into the land which had\\nbeen peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken,\\nwhich was discovered by the people of Zarahemla, it being the\\nplace of their first landing.\\n\\nAlma 22:31\\n 31 And they came from there up into the south wilderness.  Thus\\nthe land on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on\\nthe southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which\\nis filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part\\nof which had come from the land northward for food.\\n\\nAlma 22:32\\n 32 And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half's\\njourney for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land\\nDesolation, from the east to the west sea; and thus the land of\\nNephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water,\\nthere being a small neck of land between the land northward and\\nthe land southward.\\n\\nAlma 22:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land\\nBountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the\\nNephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had\\nhemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they should\\nhave no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun\\nthe land northward.\\n\\nAlma 22:34\\n 34 Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only\\nin the land of Nephi, and the wilderness round about.  Now this\\nwas wisdom in the Nephites--as the Lamanites were an enemy to\\nthem, they would not suffer their afflictions on every hand, and\\nalso that they might have a country whither they might flee,\\naccording to their desires.\\n\\nAlma 22:35\\n 35 And now I, after having said this, return again to the\\naccount of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren.\\n\\nAlma 23\\nChapter 23\\n\\nAlma 23:1\\n 1 Behold, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites\\nsent a proclamation among all his people, that they should not\\nlay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor\\neither of their brethren who should go forth preaching the word\\nof God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any part of their\\nland.\\n\\nAlma 23:2\\n 2 Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay\\ntheir hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison;\\nneither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them\\nout of their synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should they\\ncast stones at them, but that they should have free access to\\ntheir houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries.\\n\\nAlma 23:3\\n 3 And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to\\ntheir desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and\\nall his household; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout\\nthe land unto his people, that the word of God might have no\\nobstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land,\\nthat his people might be convinced concerning the wicked\\ntraditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced\\nthat they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder,\\nnor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to\\ncommit any manner of wickedness.\\n\\nAlma 23:4\\n 4 And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this\\nproclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from city to\\ncity, and from one house of worship to another, establishing\\nchurches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout the\\nland among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God\\namong them; and thus they began to have great success.\\n\\nAlma 23:5\\n 5 And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea,\\nthousands were brought to believe in the traditions of the\\nNephites; and they were taught the records and prophecies which\\nwere handed down even to the present time.\\n\\nAlma 23:6\\n 6 And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed,\\nor as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through\\nthe preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit\\nof revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working\\nmiracles in them--yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as\\nmany of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were\\nconverted unto the Lord, never did fall away.\\n\\nAlma 23:7\\n 7 For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the\\nweapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God\\nany more, neither against any of their brethren.\\n\\nAlma 23:8\\n 8 Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord:\\n\\nAlma 23:9\\n 9 The people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Ishmael;\\n\\nAlma 23:10\\n 10 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land\\nof Middoni;\\n\\nAlma 23:11\\n 11 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the city\\nof Nephi;\\n\\nAlma 23:12\\n 12 And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land\\nof Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city\\nof Lemuel, and in the city of Shimnilom.\\n\\nAlma 23:13\\n 13 And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which\\nwere converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down\\nthe weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war;\\nand they were all Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 23:14\\n 14 And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither\\nwere any of the Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and\\nalso the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land\\nwheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all their\\ncities.\\n\\nAlma 23:15\\n 15 Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in\\nwhich they did repent and come to the knowledge of the truth, and\\nwere converted.\\n\\nAlma 23:16\\n 16 And now it came to pass that the king and those who were\\nconverted were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby\\nthey might be distinguished from their brethren; therefore the\\nking consulted with Aaron and many of their priests, concerning\\nthe name that they should take upon them, that they might be\\ndistinguished.\\n\\nAlma 23:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that they called their names\\nAnti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were called by this name and were no\\nmore called Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 23:18\\n 18 And they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they\\nwere friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a\\ncorrespondence with them, and the curse of God did no more follow\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 24\\nChapter 24\\n\\nAlma 24:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and\\nthe Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the\\nland of Helam, and who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in\\nfine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and\\nhad not taken upon them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred\\nup by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their\\nbrethren.\\n\\nAlma 24:2\\n 2 And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even\\ninsomuch that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch\\nthat they would not that he should be their king; therefore, they\\ntook up arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.\\n\\nAlma 24:3\\n 3 Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called\\nhis name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.\\n\\nAlma 24:4\\n 4 And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites\\nbegan to make preparations for war against the people of God.\\n\\nAlma 24:5\\n 5 Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up\\nwith him saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their\\nbrethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon\\nmet all his brethren; and from thence they came to the land of\\nIshmael that they might hold a council with Lamoni and also with\\nhis brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend\\nthemselves against the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 24:6\\n 6 Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been\\nconverted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their\\nbrethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war;\\nyea, and also their king commanded them that they should not.\\n\\nAlma 24:7\\n 7 Now, these are the words which he said unto the people\\nconcerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that\\nour great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the\\nNephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to convince us of the\\ntraditions of our wicked fathers.\\n\\nAlma 24:8\\n 8 And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a\\nportion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a\\ncorrespondence with these brethren, the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 24:9\\n 9 And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this\\ncorrespondence we have been convinced of our sins, and of the\\nmany murders which we have committed.\\n\\nAlma 24:10\\n 10 And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath\\ngranted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also\\nthat he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which\\nwe have committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts,\\nthrough the merits of his Son.\\n\\nAlma 24:11\\n 11 And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we\\ncould do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of\\nall our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to\\nget God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we\\ncould do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take\\naway our stain--\\n\\nAlma 24:12\\n 12 Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our\\nstains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our\\nswords no more with the blood of our brethren.\\n\\nAlma 24:13\\n 13 Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that\\nthey be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps,\\nif we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed\\nbright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall\\nbe shed for the atonement of our sins.\\n\\nAlma 24:14\\n 14 And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things\\nknown unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made\\nthese things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our\\nsouls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy\\nhe doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might\\nbe made known unto us as well as unto future generations.\\n\\nAlma 24:15\\n 15 Oh, how merciful is our God!  And now behold, since it has\\nbeen as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us,\\nand our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they\\nmay be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or\\nat the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be\\njudged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our\\nbrethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean\\nthereby.\\n\\nAlma 24:16\\n 16 And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us,\\nbehold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them\\ndeep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony\\nthat we have never used them, at the last day; and if our\\nbrethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be\\nsaved.\\n\\nAlma 24:17\\n 17 And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of\\nthese sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they\\ntook their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the\\nshedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the\\nearth.\\nAlma 24:18\\n 18 And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God,\\nand also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the\\nshedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and\\ncovenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their\\nbrethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take\\naway from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than\\nspend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with\\ntheir hands.\\n\\nAlma 24:19\\n 19 And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to\\nbelieve and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer\\neven unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they\\nburied their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war,\\nfor peace.\\n\\nAlma 24:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made\\npreparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the\\npurpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his\\nstead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out\\nof the land.\\n\\nAlma 24:21\\n 21 Now when the people saw that they were coming against them\\nthey went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them\\nto the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus\\nthey were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon\\nthem, and began to slay them with the sword.\\n\\nAlma 24:22\\n 22 And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a\\nthousand and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for\\nthey have gone to dwell with their God.\\n\\nAlma 24:23\\n 23 Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee\\nfrom the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand\\nor to the left, but that they would lie down and perish, and\\npraised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword--\\n\\nAlma 24:24\\n 24 Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying\\nthem; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for\\nthose of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they\\nrepented of the things which they had done.\\n\\nAlma 24:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of\\nwar, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for\\nthe murders which they had committed; and they came down even as\\ntheir brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were\\nlifted to slay them.\\n\\nAlma 24:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that\\nday by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had\\nbeen slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to\\ndoubt but what they were saved.\\n\\nAlma 24:27\\n 27 And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there\\nwere more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth;\\nthus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation\\nof his people.\\n\\nAlma 24:28\\n 28 Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so\\nmany of their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, the\\ngreatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors.\\n\\nAlma 24:29\\n 29 Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there\\nwere none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the\\norder of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and\\nLemuel.\\n\\nAlma 24:30\\n 30 And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have\\nbeen once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great\\nknowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have\\nfallen away into sin and transgression, they become more\\nhardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had\\nnever known these things.\\n\\nAlma 25\\nChapter 25\\n\\nAlma 25:1\\n 1 And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more\\nangry because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore\\nvengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay\\nthe people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time.\\n\\nAlma 25:2\\n 2 But they took their armies and went over into the borders of\\nthe land of Zarahemla, and fell upon the people who were in the\\nland of Ammonihah, and destroyed them.\\n\\nAlma 25:3\\n 3 And after that, they had many battles with the Nephites, in\\nthe which they were driven and slain.\\n\\nAlma 25:4\\n 4 And among the Lamanites who were slain were almost all the\\nseed of Amulon and his brethren, who were the priests of Noah,\\nand they were slain by the hands of the Nephites;\\n\\nAlma 25:5\\n 5 And the remainder, having fled into the east wilderness, and\\nhaving usurped the power and authority over the Lamanites, caused\\nthat many of the Lamanites should perish by fire because of their\\nbelief--\\n\\nAlma 25:6\\n 6 For many of them, after having suffered much loss and so many\\nafflictions, began to be stirred up in remembrance of the words\\nwhich Aaron and his brethren had preached to them in their land;\\ntherefore they began to disbelieve the traditions of their\\nfathers, and to believe in the Lord, and that he gave great power\\nunto the Nephites; and thus there were many of them converted in\\nthe wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 25:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that those rulers who were the remnant of\\nthe children of Amulon caused that they should be put to death,\\nyea, all those that believed in these things.\\n\\nAlma 25:8\\n 8 Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should\\nbe stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the\\nwilderness; and the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon\\nand his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the\\neast wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 25:9\\n 9 And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites.  Thus\\nthe words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said\\nconcerning the seed of the priests who caused that he should\\nsuffer death by fire.\\n\\nAlma 25:10\\n 10 For he said unto them: What ye shall do unto me shall be a\\ntype of things to come.\\n\\nAlma 25:11\\n 11 And now Abinadi was the first that suffered death by fire\\nbecause of his belief in God; now this is what he meant, that\\nmany should suffer death by fire, according as he had suffered.\\n\\nAlma 25:12\\n 12 And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should\\ncause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and\\nthat they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep\\nhaving no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts; and now\\nbehold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the\\nLamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.\\n\\nAlma 25:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they\\ncould not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own\\nland; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael\\nand the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of\\nGod, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.\\n\\nAlma 25:14\\n 14 And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as\\ntheir brethren had, and they began to be a righteous people; and\\nthey did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep\\nhis commandments and his statutes.\\n\\nAlma 25:15\\n 15 Yea, and they did keep the law of Moses; for it was expedient\\nthat they should keep the law of Moses as yet, for it was not all\\nfulfilled.  But notwithstanding the law of Moses, they did look\\nforward to the coming of Christ, considering that the law of\\nMoses was a type of his coming, and believing that they must keep\\nthose outward performances until the time that he should be\\nrevealed unto them.\\n\\nAlma 25:16\\n 16 Now they did not suppose that salvation came by the law of\\nMoses; but the law of Moses did serve to strengthen their faith\\nin Christ; and thus they did retain a hope through faith, unto\\neternal salvation, relying upon the spirit of prophecy, which\\nspake of those things to come.\\n\\nAlma 25:17\\n 17 And now behold, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni, and\\ntheir brethren did rejoice exceedingly, for the success which\\nthey had had among the Lamanites, seeing that the Lord had\\ngranted unto them according to their prayers, and that he had\\nalso verified his word unto them in every particular.\\n\\nAlma 26\\nChapter 26\\n\\nAlma 26:1\\n 1 And now, these are the words of Ammon to his brethren, which\\nsay thus: My brothers and my brethren, behold I say unto you, how\\ngreat reason have we to rejoice; for could we have supposed when\\nwe started from the land of Zarahemla that God would have granted\\nunto us such great blessings?\\n\\nAlma 26:2\\n 2 And now, I ask, what great blessings has he bestowed upon us? \\nCan ye tell?\\n\\nAlma 26:3\\n 3 Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites,\\nwere in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how\\nmany of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! \\nAnd this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that\\nwe have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about\\nthis great work.\\n\\nAlma 26:4\\n 4 Behold, thousands of them do rejoice, and have been brought\\ninto the fold of God.\\n\\nAlma 26:5\\n 5 Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did\\nthrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the\\nday long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! \\nAnd they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not\\nwasted.\\n\\nAlma 26:6\\n 6 Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last\\nday; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds;\\nbut when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in\\ntheir place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea,\\nneither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the\\nenemy listeth to carry them.\\n\\nAlma 26:7\\n 7 But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest,\\nand they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day.\\n\\nAlma 26:8\\n 8 Blessed be the name of our God; let us sing to his praise,\\nyea, let us give thanks to his holy name, for he doth work\\nrighteousness forever.\\n\\nAlma 26:9\\n 9 For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these\\nour dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would\\nstill have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they\\nwould also have been strangers to God.\\n\\nAlma 26:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that when Ammon had said these words, his\\nbrother Aaron rebuked him, saying: Ammon, I fear that thy joy\\ndoth carry thee away unto boasting.\\n\\nAlma 26:11\\n 11 But Ammon said unto him: I do not boast in my own strength,\\nnor in my own wisdom; but behold, my joy is full, yea, my heart\\nis brim with joy, and I will rejoice in my God.\\n\\nAlma 26:12\\n 12 Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak;\\ntherefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God,\\nfor in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty\\nmiracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise\\nhis name forever.\\n\\nAlma 26:13\\n 13 Behold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from\\nthe pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love,\\nand this because of the power of his word which is in us,\\ntherefore have we not great reason to rejoice?\\n\\nAlma 26:14\\n 14 Yea, we have reason to praise him forever, for he is the Most\\nHigh God, and has loosed our brethren from the chains of hell.\\n\\nAlma 26:15\\n 15 Yea, they were encircled about with everlasting darkness and\\ndestruction; but behold, he has brought them into his everlasting\\nlight, yea, into everlasting salvation; and they are encircled\\nabout with the matchless bounty of his love; yea, and we have\\nbeen instruments in his hands of doing this great and marvelous\\nwork.\\n\\nAlma 26:16\\n 16 Therefore, let us glory, yea, we will glory in the Lord; yea,\\nwe will rejoice, for our joy is full; yea, we will praise our God\\nforever.  Behold, who can glory too much in the Lord?  Yea, who\\ncan say too much of his great power, and of his mercy, and of his\\nlong-suffering towards the children of men?  Behold, I say unto\\nyou, I cannot say the smallest part which I feel.\\n\\nAlma 26:17\\n 17 Who could have supposed that our God would have been so\\nmerciful as to have snatched us from our awful, sinful, and\\npolluted state?\\n\\nAlma 26:18\\n 18 Behold, we went forth even in wrath, with mighty threatenings\\nto destroy his church.\\n\\nAlma 26:19\\n 19 Oh then, why did he not consign us to an awful destruction,\\nyea, why did he not let the sword of his justice fall upon us,\\nand doom us to eternal despair?\\n\\nAlma 26:20\\n 20 Oh, my soul, almost as it were, fleeth at the thought. \\nBehold, he did not exercise his justice upon us, but in his great\\nmercy hath brought us over that everlasting gulf of death and\\nmisery, even to the salvation of our souls.\\n\\nAlma 26:21\\n 21 And now behold, my brethren, what natural man is there that\\nknoweth these things?  I say unto you, there is none that knoweth\\nthese things, save it be the penitent.\\n\\nAlma 26:22\\n 22 Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth\\nforth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing--unto\\nsuch it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it\\nshall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed;\\nyea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls\\nto repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these\\nour brethren to repentance.\\n\\nAlma 26:23\\n 23 Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our\\nbrethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi,\\nto preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us\\nto scorn?\\n\\nAlma 26:24\\n 24 For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the\\nLamanites to the knowledge of the truth?  Do ye suppose that ye\\ncan convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions\\nof their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose\\nhearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been\\nspent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of\\na transgressor from the beginning?  Now my brethren, ye remember\\nthat this was their language.\\n\\nAlma 26:25\\n 25 And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them,\\nthat we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest\\nthey overrun us and destroy us.\\n\\nAlma 26:26\\n 26 But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness\\nnot with the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent\\nthat perhaps we might save some few of their souls.\\n\\nAlma 26:27\\n 27 Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn\\nback, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy\\nbrethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine\\nafflictions, and I will give unto you success.\\n\\nAlma 26:28\\n 28 And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them;\\nand we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered\\nevery privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house,\\nrelying upon the mercies of the world--not upon the mercies of\\nthe world alone but upon the mercies of God.\\n\\nAlma 26:29\\n 29 And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we\\nhave taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them\\nupon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and\\ntheir synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast out, and\\nmocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have\\nbeen stoned, and taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into\\nprison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been\\ndelivered again.\\n\\nAlma 26:30\\n 30 And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this,\\nthat perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul; and we\\nsupposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the\\nmeans of saving some.\\n\\nAlma 26:31\\n 31 Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our\\nlabors; and are they few?  I say unto you, Nay, they are many;\\nyea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love\\ntowards their brethren and also towards us.\\n\\nAlma 26:32\\n 32 For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even\\nto take the life of their enemy; and they have buried their\\nweapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards\\ntheir brethren.\\n\\nAlma 26:33\\n 33 And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love\\nin all the land?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not,\\neven among the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 26:34\\n 34 For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren;\\nthey would not suffer themselves to be slain.  But behold how\\nmany of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they\\nhave gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred\\nto sin.\\n\\nAlma 26:35\\n 35 Now have we not reason to rejoice?  Yea, I say unto you,\\nthere never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we,\\nsince the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto\\nboasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all\\nunderstanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful\\nBeing, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe\\non his name.\\n\\nAlma 26:36\\n 36 Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my\\nlife and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption\\nfrom everlasting wo.  Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has\\nbeen mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of\\nIsrael, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I\\nsay, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us,\\nwanderers in a strange land.\\n\\nAlma 26:37\\n 37 Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people,\\nwhatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and\\nhis bowels of mercy are over all the earth.  Now this is my joy,\\nand my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my\\nGod forever.  Amen.\\n\\nAlma 27\\nChapter 27\\n\\nAlma 27:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to\\nwar against the Nephites had found, after their many struggles to\\ndestroy them, that it was in vain to seek their destruction, they\\nreturned again to the land of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 27:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their\\nloss, were exceedingly angry.  And when they saw that they could\\nnot seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the\\npeople in anger against their brethren, the people of\\nAnti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them.\\n\\nAlma 27:3\\n 3 Now this people again refused to take their arms, and they\\nsuffered themselves to be slain according to the desires of their\\nenemies.\\n\\nAlma 27:4\\n 4 Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction\\namong those whom they so dearly beloved, and among those who had\\nso dearly beloved them--for they were treated as though they were\\nangels sent from God to save them from everlasting\\ndestruction--therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw this\\ngreat work of destruction, they were moved with compassion, and\\nthey said unto the king:\\n\\nAlma 27:5\\n 5 Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let us go\\ndown to the land of Zarahemla to our brethren the Nephites, and\\nflee out of the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.\\n\\nAlma 27:6\\n 6 But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy\\nus, because of the many murders and sins we have committed\\nagainst them.\\n\\nAlma 27:7\\n 7 And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he\\nsay unto us, go down unto our brethren, will ye go?\\n\\nAlma 27:8\\n 8 And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go,\\nwe will go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves\\nuntil we repair unto them the many murders and sins which we have\\ncommitted against them.\\n\\nAlma 27:9\\n 9 But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our\\nbrethren, which was established by my father, that there should\\nbe any slaves among them; therefore let us go down and rely upon\\nthe mercies of our brethren.\\n\\nAlma 27:10\\n 10 But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he\\nsaith unto us go, we will go; otherwise we will perish in the\\nland.\\n\\nAlma 27:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the Lord,\\nand the Lord said unto him:\\n\\nAlma 27:12\\n 12 Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for\\nSatan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir\\nup the Lamanites to anger against their brethren to slay them;\\ntherefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people\\nin this generation, for I will preserve them.\\n\\nAlma 27:13\\n 13 And now it came to pass that Ammon went and told the king all\\nthe words which the Lord had said unto him.\\n\\nAlma 27:14\\n 14 And they gathered together all their people, yea, all the\\npeople of the Lord, and did gather together all their flocks and\\nherds, and departed out of the land, and came into the wilderness\\nwhich divided the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla, and\\ncame over near the borders of the land.\\n\\nAlma 27:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and\\nmy brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye\\nshall remain here until we return; and we will try the hearts of\\nour brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into their\\nland.\\n\\nAlma 27:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the\\nland, that he and his brethren met Alma, over in the place of\\nwhich has been spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting.\\n\\nAlma 27:17\\n 17 Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea,\\nhe was swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting\\nof his strength; and he fell again to the earth.\\n\\nAlma 27:18\\n 18 Now was not this exceeding joy?  Behold, this is joy which\\nnone receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of\\nhappiness.\\n\\nAlma 27:19\\n 19 Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great,\\nand also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold their\\njoy was not that to exceed their strength.\\n\\nAlma 27:20\\n 20 And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back\\nto the land of Zarahemla; even to his own house.  And they went\\nand told the chief judge all the things that had happened unto\\nthem in the land of Nephi, among their brethren, the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 27:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a proclamation\\nthroughout all the land, desiring the voice of the people\\nconcerning the admitting their brethren, who were the people of\\nAnti-Nephi-Lehi.\\n\\nAlma 27:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that the voice of the people came,\\nsaying: Behold, we will give up the land of Jershon, which is on\\nthe east by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful, which is on\\nthe south of the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the\\nland which we will give unto our brethren for an inheritance.\\n\\nAlma 27:23\\n 23 And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon\\nand the land Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land\\nJershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their\\nfear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should\\ncommit sin; and this their great fear came because of their sore\\nrepentance which they had, on account of their many murders and\\ntheir awful wickedness.\\n\\nAlma 27:24\\n 24 And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they\\nmay inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their\\nenemies with our armies, on condition that they will give us a\\nportion of their substance to assist us that we may maintain our\\narmies.\\n\\nAlma 27:25\\n 25 Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he\\nreturned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with\\nhim, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and\\nmade known unto them all these things.  And Alma also related\\nunto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.\\n\\nAlma 27:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them. \\nAnd they went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession\\nof the land of Jershon; and they were called by the Nephites the\\npeople of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by that name\\never after.\\n\\nAlma 27:27\\n 27 And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered\\namong the people who were of the church of God.  And they were\\nalso distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards\\nmen; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things;\\nand they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.\\n\\nAlma 27:28\\n 28 And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren\\nwith the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed\\nupon to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did\\nlook upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and\\nviews of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was\\nswallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.\\n\\nAlma 27:29\\n 29 Therefore, they would suffer death in the most aggravating\\nand distressing manner which could be inflicted by their\\nbrethren, before they would take the sword or cimeter to smite\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 27:30\\n 30 And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly\\nfavored people of the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 28\\nChapter 28\\n\\nAlma 28:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were\\nestablished in the land of Jershon, and a church also established\\nin the land of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set\\nround about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders round\\nabout the land of Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites\\nhad followed their brethren into the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 28:2\\n 2 And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one\\nas never had been known among all the people in the land from the\\ntime Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the\\nLamanites were slain and scattered abroad.\\n\\nAlma 28:3\\n 3 Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the\\npeople of Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites were driven and\\nscattered, and the people of Nephi returned again to their land.\\n\\nAlma 28:4\\n 4 And now this was a time that there was a great mourning and\\nlamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people\\nof Nephi--\\n\\nAlma 28:5\\n 5 Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also\\nof fathers mourning for their sons, and the daughter for the\\nbrother, yea, the brother for the father; and thus the cry of\\nmourning was heard among all of them, mourning for their kindred\\nwho had been slain.\\n\\nAlma 28:6\\n 6 And now surely this was a sorrowful day; yea, a time of\\nsolemnity, and a time of much fasting and prayer.\\n\\nAlma 28:7\\n 7 And thus endeth the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges\\nover the people of Nephi;\\n\\nAlma 28:8\\n 8 And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their\\njourneyings in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land,\\ntheir sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible\\njoy, and the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of\\nJershon.  And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless\\ntheir souls forever.\\n\\nAlma 28:9\\n 9 And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the\\nNephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the\\nLamanites; and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is\\nended.\\n\\nAlma 28:10\\n 10 And from the first year to the fifteenth has brought to pass\\nthe destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to\\npass an awful scene of bloodshed.\\n\\nAlma 28:11\\n 11 And the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth,\\nwhile the bodies of many thousands are moldering in heaps upon\\nthe face of the earth; yea, and many thousands are mourning for\\nthe loss of their kindred, because they have reason to fear,\\naccording to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to\\na state of endless wo.\\n\\nAlma 28:12\\n 12 While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of\\ntheir kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even\\nknow, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are raised\\nto dwell at the right hand of God, in a state of never-ending\\nhappiness.\\n\\nAlma 28:13\\n 13 And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of\\nsin and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by\\nthe cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of\\nmen.\\n\\nAlma 28:14\\n 14 And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor\\nin the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of\\nsorrow, and also of rejoicing--sorrow because of death and\\ndestruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ\\nunto life.\\n\\nAlma 29\\nChapter 29\\n\\nAlma 29:1\\n 1 O that I were an angel, and could have the wish of mine heart,\\nthat I might go forth and speak with the trump of God, with a\\nvoice to shake the earth, and cry repentance unto every people!\\n\\nAlma 29:2\\n 2 Yea, I would declare unto every soul, as with the voice of\\nthunder, repentance and the plan of redemption, that they should\\nrepent and come unto our God, that there might not be more sorrow\\nupon all the face of the earth.\\n\\nAlma 29:3\\n 3 But behold, I am a man, and do sin in my wish; for I ought to\\nbe content with the things which the Lord hath allotted unto me.\\n\\nAlma 29:4\\n 4 I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a\\njust God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their\\ndesire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that\\nhe allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are\\nunalterable, according to their wills, whether they be unto\\nsalvation or unto destruction.\\n\\nAlma 29:5\\n 5 Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men;\\nhe that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that\\nknoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his\\ndesires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or\\nremorse of conscience.\\n\\nAlma 29:6\\n 6 Now, seeing that I know these things, why should I desire more\\nthan to perform the work to which I have been called?\\n\\nAlma 29:7\\n 7 Why should I desire that I were an angel, that I could speak\\nunto all the ends of the earth?\\n\\nAlma 29:8\\n 8 For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own\\nnation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he\\nseeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord\\ndoth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.\\n\\nAlma 29:9\\n 9 I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in\\nit.  I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord\\nhath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may\\nbe an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to\\nrepentance; and this is my joy.\\n\\nAlma 29:10\\n 10 And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent,\\nand coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with\\njoy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even\\nthat he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his\\nmerciful arm which he extended towards me.\\n\\nAlma 29:11\\n 11 Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I\\nsurely do know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and\\nby this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of\\nAbraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them\\nout of bondage.\\n\\nAlma 29:12\\n 12 Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers;\\nand that same God who delivered them out of the hands of the\\nEgyptians did deliver them out of bondage.\\n\\nAlma 29:13\\n 13 Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them;\\nyea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to\\npreach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success,\\nin the which my joy is full.\\n\\nAlma 29:14\\n 14 But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more\\nfull because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to\\nthe land of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 29:15\\n 15 Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth\\nmuch fruit; and how great shall be their reward!\\n\\nAlma 29:16\\n 16 Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul\\nis carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as\\nit were, so great is my joy.\\n\\nAlma 29:17\\n 17 And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may\\nsit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are\\nthe fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that\\nthey may praise him forever.  And may God grant that it may be\\ndone according to my words, even as I have spoken.  Amen.\\n\\nAlma 30\\nChapter 30\\n\\nAlma 30:1\\n 1 Behold, now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon\\nwere established in the land of Jershon, yea, and also after the\\nLamanites were driven out of the land, and their dead were buried\\nby the people of the land--\\n\\nAlma 30:2\\n 2 Now their dead were not numbered because of the greatness of\\ntheir numbers; neither were the dead of the Nephites\\nnumbered--but it came to pass after they had buried their dead,\\nand also after the days of fasting, and mourning, and prayer,\\n(and it was in the sixteenth year of the reign of the judges over\\nthe people of Nephi) there began to be continual peace throughout\\nall the land.\\n\\nAlma 30:3\\n 3 Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of\\nthe Lord; and they were strict in observing the ordinances of\\nGod, according to the law of Moses; for they were taught to keep\\nthe law of Moses until it should be fulfilled.\\n\\nAlma 30:4\\n 4 And thus the people did have no disturbance in all the\\nsixteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of\\nNephi.\\n\\nAlma 30:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the\\nseventeenth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual\\npeace.\\n\\nAlma 30:6\\n 6 But it came to pass in the latter end of the seventeenth year,\\nthere came a man into the land of Zarahemla, and he was\\nAnti-Christ, for he began to preach unto the people against the\\nprophecies which had been spoken by the prophets, concerning the\\ncoming of Christ.\\n\\nAlma 30:7\\n 7 Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was\\nstrictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a\\nlaw which should bring men on to unequal grounds.\\n\\nAlma 30:8\\n 8 For thus saith the scripture: Choose ye this day, whom ye will\\nserve.\\n\\nAlma 30:9\\n 9 Now if a man desired to serve God, it was his privilege; or\\nrather, if he believed in God it was his privilege to serve him;\\nbut if he did not believe in him there was no law to punish him.\\n\\nAlma 30:10\\n 10 But if he murdered he was punished unto death; and if he\\nrobbed he was also punished; and if he stole he was also\\npunished; and if he committed adultery he was also punished; yea,\\nfor all this wickedness they were punished.\\n\\nAlma 30:11\\n 11 For there was a law that men should be judged according to\\ntheir crimes.  Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's\\nbelief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which\\nhe had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.\\n\\nAlma 30:12\\n 12 And this Anti-Christ, whose name was Korihor, (and the law\\ncould have no hold upon him) began to preach unto the people that\\nthere should be no Christ.  And after this manner did he preach,\\nsaying:\\n\\nAlma 30:13\\n 13 O ye that are bound down under a foolish and a vain hope, why\\ndo ye yoke yourselves with such foolish things?  Why do ye look\\nfor a Christ?  For no man can know of anything which is to come.\\n\\nAlma 30:14\\n 14 Behold, these things which ye call prophecies, which ye say\\nare handed down by holy prophets, behold, they are foolish\\ntraditions of your fathers.\\n\\nAlma 30:15\\n 15 How do ye know of their surety?  Behold, ye cannot know of\\nthings which ye do not see; therefore ye cannot know that there\\nshall be a Christ.\\n\\nAlma 30:16\\n 16 Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins.\\n\\nBut behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this\\nderangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your\\nfathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are\\nnot so.\\n\\nAlma 30:17\\n 17 And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them\\nthat there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but\\nevery man fared in this life according to the management of the\\ncreature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius,\\nand that every man conquered according to his strength; and\\nwhatsoever a man did was no crime.\\n\\nAlma 30:18\\n 18 And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of\\nmany, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness,\\nyea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit\\nwhoredoms--telling them that when a man was dead, that was the\\nend thereof.\\n\\nAlma 30:19\\n 19 Now this man went over to the land of Jershon also, to preach\\nthese things among the people of Ammon, who were once the people\\nof the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 30:20\\n 20 But behold they were more wise than many of the Nephites; for\\nthey took him, and bound him, and carried him before Ammon, who\\nwas a high priest over that people.\\n\\nAlma 30:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that he caused that he should be carried\\nout of the land.  And he came over into the land of Gideon, and\\nbegan to preach unto them also; and here he did not have much\\nsuccess, for he was taken and bound and carried before the high\\npriest, and also the chief judge over the land.\\n\\nAlma 30:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that the high priest said unto him: Why\\ndo ye go about perverting the ways of the Lord?  Why do ye teach\\nthis people that there shall be no Christ, to interrupt their\\nrejoicings?  Why do ye speak against all the prophecies of the\\nholy prophets?\\n\\nAlma 30:23\\n 23 Now the high priest's name was Giddonah.  And Korihor said\\nunto him: Because I do not teach the foolish traditions of your\\nfathers, and because I do not teach this people to bind\\nthemselves down under the foolish ordinances and performances\\nwhich are laid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and\\nauthority over them, to keep them in ignorance, that they may not\\nlift up their heads, but be brought down according to thy words.\\n\\nAlma 30:24\\n 24 Ye say that this people is a free people.  Behold, I say they\\nare in bondage.  Ye say that those ancient prophecies are true. \\nBehold, I say that ye do not know that they are true.\\n\\nAlma 30:25\\n 25 Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people,\\nbecause of the transgression of a parent.  Behold, I say that a\\nchild is not guilty because of its parents.\\n\\nAlma 30:26\\n 26 And ye also say that Christ shall come.  But behold, I say\\nthat ye do not know that there shall be a Christ.  And ye say\\nalso that he shall be slain for the sins of the world--\\n\\nAlma 30:27\\n 27 And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish\\ntraditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires;\\nand ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may\\nglut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst\\nnot look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their\\nrights and privileges.\\n\\nAlma 30:28\\n 28 Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest\\nthey should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to\\ntheir desires, and have brought them to believe, by their\\ntraditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and\\ntheir pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do\\naccording to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say\\nis God--a being who never has been seen or known, who never was\\nnor ever will be.\\n\\nAlma 30:29\\n 29 Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness\\nof his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even\\nagainst God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they\\ncaused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into\\nthe hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla,\\nthat he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was\\ngovernor over all the land.\\n\\nAlma 30:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and\\nthe chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the\\nland of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.\\n\\nAlma 30:31\\n 31 And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and\\ndid revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of\\nleading away the people after the silly traditions of their\\nfathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.\\n\\nAlma 30:32\\n 32 Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut\\nourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have\\nlabored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges\\nuntil now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my\\nmany travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto\\nmy people.\\n\\nAlma 30:33\\n 33 And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in\\nthe church, I have never received so much as even one senine for\\nmy labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the\\njudgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law\\nfor our time.\\n\\nAlma 30:34\\n 34 And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the\\nchurch, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it\\nwere to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy\\nof our brethren?\\n\\nAlma 30:35\\n 35 Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get\\ngain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? \\nAnd now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes\\nsuch joy in their hearts?\\n\\nAlma 30:36\\n 36 And Korihor answered him, Yea.\\n\\nAlma 30:37\\n 37 And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a\\nGod?\\n\\nAlma 30:38\\n 38 And he answered, Nay.\\n\\nAlma 30:39\\n 39 Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a\\nGod, and also deny the Christ?  For behold, I say unto you, I\\nknow there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.\\n\\nAlma 30:40\\n 40 And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that\\nChrist cometh not?  I say unto you that ye have none, save it be\\nyour word only.\\n\\nAlma 30:41\\n 41 But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these\\nthings are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto\\nyou that they are true; and will ye deny them?  Believest thou\\nthat these things are true?\\n\\nAlma 30:42\\n 42 Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed\\nwith a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that\\nit may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you,\\nand he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy\\nthe children of God.\\n\\nAlma 30:43\\n 43 And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign,\\nthat I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me\\nthat he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of\\nthy words.\\n\\nAlma 30:44\\n 44 But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye\\ntempt your God?  Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have\\nthe testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy\\nprophets?  The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all\\nthings denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things\\nthat are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also\\nall the planets which move in their regular form do witness that\\nthere is a Supreme Creator.\\n\\nAlma 30:45\\n 45 And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this\\npeople, testifying unto them there is no God?  And yet will ye\\ndeny against all these witnesses?  And he said: Yea, I will deny,\\nexcept ye shall show me a sign.\\n\\nAlma 30:46\\n 46 And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am\\ngrieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will\\nstill resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nAlma 30:47\\n 47 But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than\\nthat thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to\\ndestruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore\\nif thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou\\nshalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more,\\nthat thou shalt not deceive this people any more.\\n\\nAlma 30:48\\n 48 Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a\\nGod, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also,\\nthat ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a\\nsign, I will not believe.\\n\\nAlma 30:49\\n 49 Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a\\nsign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and\\nI say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye\\nshall no more have utterance.\\n\\nAlma 30:50\\n 50 Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb,\\nthat he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.\\n\\nAlma 30:51\\n 51 And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand\\nand wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power\\nof God?  In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his\\nsign?  Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee\\na sign?  Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye\\ndispute more?\\n\\nAlma 30:52\\n 52 And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that\\nI am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it\\nwere the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always\\nknew that there was a God.\\n\\nAlma 30:53\\n 53 But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto\\nme in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this\\npeople, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God.  And\\nhe said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that\\nwhich I should say.  And I have taught his words; and I taught\\nthem because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I\\ntaught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I\\nverily believed that they were true; and for this cause I\\nwithstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse\\nupon me.\\n\\nAlma 30:54\\n 54 Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray\\nunto God, that the curse might be taken from him.\\n\\nAlma 30:55\\n 55 But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from\\nthee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people;\\ntherefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.\\n\\nAlma 30:56\\n 56 And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of\\nKorihor; but he was cast out, and went about from house to house\\nbegging for his food.\\n\\nAlma 30:57\\n 57 Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was\\nimmediately published throughout all the land; yea, the\\nproclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people\\nin the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words\\nof Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same\\njudgments would come unto them.\\n\\nAlma 30:58\\n 58 And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the\\nwickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again\\nunto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the\\nmanner of Korihor.  And Korihor did go about from house to house,\\nbegging food for his support.\\n\\nAlma 30:59\\n 59 And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people,\\nyea, among a people who had separated themselves from the\\nNephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man\\nwhose name was Zoram--and as he went forth amongst them, behold,\\nhe was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.\\n\\nAlma 30:60\\n 60 And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the\\nLord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his\\nchildren at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to\\nhell.\\n\\nAlma 31\\nChapter 31\\n\\nAlma 31:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having\\nreceived tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of\\nthe Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the\\nhearts of the people to bow down to dumb idols, his heart again\\nbegan to sicken because of the iniquity of the people.\\n\\nAlma 31:2\\n 2 For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of\\niniquity among his people; therefore his heart was exceedingly\\nsorrowful because of the separation of the Zoramites from the\\nNephites.\\n\\nAlma 31:3\\n 3 Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land\\nwhich they called Antionum, which was east of the land of\\nZarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which\\nwas south of the land of Jershon, which also bordered upon the\\nwilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 31:4\\n 4 Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter\\ninto a correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be\\nthe means of great loss on the part of the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 31:5\\n 5 And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to\\nlead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more\\npowerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or\\nanything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma\\nthought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the\\nword of God.\\n\\nAlma 31:6\\n 6 Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he\\ndid leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he\\ntook with him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek;\\nand he also took two of his sons.\\n\\nAlma 31:7\\n 7 Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name\\nwas Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were\\nShiblon and Corianton; and these are the names of those who went\\nwith him among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the word.\\n\\nAlma 31:8\\n 8 Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore\\nthey had had the word of God preached unto them.\\n\\nAlma 31:9\\n 9 But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not\\nobserve to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes,\\naccording to the law of Moses.\\n\\nAlma 31:10\\n 10 Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to\\ncontinue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might\\nnot enter into temptation.\\n\\nAlma 31:11\\n 11 Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very\\nmany instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren\\nwent into the land to preach the word unto them.\\n\\nAlma 31:12\\n 12 Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their\\nastonishment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues,\\nand that they did gather themselves together on one day of the\\nweek, which day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did\\nworship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never\\nbeheld;\\n\\nAlma 31:13\\n 13 For they had a place built up in the center of their\\nsynagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head,\\nand the top thereof would only admit one person.\\n\\nAlma 31:14\\n 14 Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and\\nstand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards\\nheaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:\\n\\nAlma 31:15\\n 15 Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe\\nthat thou art holy, and that thou wast a spirit, and that thou\\nart a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever.\\n\\nAlma 31:16\\n 16 Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our\\nbrethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren,\\nwhich was handed down to them by the childishness of their\\nfathers; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy\\nchildren; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there\\nshall be no Christ.\\n\\nAlma 31:17\\n 17 But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou\\nhast elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are\\nelected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which\\nholiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou\\nhast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish\\ntraditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief\\nof Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee,\\nour God.\\n\\nAlma 31:18\\n 18 And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a\\nholy people.  Amen.\\n\\nAlma 31:19\\n 19 Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his\\nsons had heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all\\nmeasure.\\n\\nAlma 31:20\\n 20 For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same\\nprayers.\\n\\nAlma 31:21\\n 21 Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being\\ninterpreted, is the holy stand.\\n\\nAlma 31:22\\n 22 Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the\\nselfsame prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were\\nchosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the\\ntradition of their brethren, and that their hearts were not\\nstolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing\\nabout.\\n\\nAlma 31:23\\n 23 Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this\\nmanner, they returned to their homes, never speaking of their God\\nagain until they had assembled themselves together again to the\\nholy stand, to offer up thanks after their manner.\\n\\nAlma 31:24\\n 24 Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that\\nthey were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their\\nhearts were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner\\nof fine goods.\\n\\nAlma 31:25\\n 25 Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto\\ngreat boasting, in their pride.\\n\\nAlma 31:26\\n 26 And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O,\\nhow long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell\\nhere below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among\\nthe children of men?\\n\\nAlma 31:27\\n 27 Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are\\nswallowed up in their pride.  Behold, O God, they cry unto thee\\nwith their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness,\\nwith the vain things of the world.\\n\\nAlma 31:28\\n 28 Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets,\\nand their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their\\nprecious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their\\nhearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say--We\\nthank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while\\nothers shall perish.\\n\\nAlma 31:29\\n 29 Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that\\nthere shall be no Christ.\\n\\nAlma 31:30\\n 30 O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness\\nand infidelity shall be among this people?  O Lord, wilt thou\\ngive me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities.  For I\\nam infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my\\nsoul.\\n\\nAlma 31:31\\n 31 O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort\\nmy soul in Christ.  O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may\\nhave strength, that I may suffer with patience these afflictions\\nwhich shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people.\\n\\nAlma 31:32\\n 32 O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success,\\nand also my fellow laborers who are with me--yea, Ammon, and\\nAaron, and Omner, and also Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two\\nsons--yea, even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord.  Yea, wilt\\nthou comfort their souls in Christ.\\n\\nAlma 31:33\\n 33 Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that\\nthey may bear their afflictions which shall come upon them\\nbecause of the iniquities of this people.\\n\\nAlma 31:34\\n 34 O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in\\nbringing them again unto thee in Christ.\\n\\nAlma 31:35\\n 35 Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them\\nare our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and\\nwisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.\\n\\nAlma 31:36\\n 36 Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words, that\\nhe clapped his hands upon all them who were with him.  And\\nbehold, as he clapped his hands upon them, they were filled with\\nthe Holy Spirit.\\n\\nAlma 31:37\\n 37 And after that they did separate themselves one from another,\\ntaking no thought for themselves what they should eat, or what\\nthey should drink, or what they should put on.\\n\\nAlma 31:38\\n 38 And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not,\\nneither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength,\\nthat they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were\\nswallowed up in the joy of Christ.  Now this was according to the\\nprayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith.\\n\\nAlma 32\\nChapter 32\\n\\nAlma 32:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to\\npreach the word of God unto the people, entering into their\\nsynagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach\\nthe word in their streets.\\n\\nAlma 32:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they\\nbegan to have success among the poor class of people; for behold,\\nthey were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of\\ntheir apparel--\\n\\nAlma 32:3\\n 3 Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their\\nsynagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness;\\ntherefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their\\nbrethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the\\nworld; and also they were poor in heart.\\n\\nAlma 32:4\\n 4 Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon\\nthe hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were\\nthose of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart,\\nbecause of their poverty as to the things of the world.\\n\\nAlma 32:5\\n 5 And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost\\namong them said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren\\ndo, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty,\\nyea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us\\nout of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build\\nwith our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our\\nexceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and\\nbehold, what shall we do?\\n\\nAlma 32:6\\n 6 And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face\\nimmediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he\\nbeheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them and that\\nthey were in a preparation to hear the word.\\n\\nAlma 32:7\\n 7 Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he\\nstretched forth his hand, and cried unto those whom he beheld,\\nwho were truly penitent, and said unto them:\\n\\nAlma 32:8\\n 8 I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are\\nye.\\n\\nAlma 32:9\\n 9 Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do?--for we are\\ncast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.\\n\\nAlma 32:10\\n 10 Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship\\nGod save it be in your synagogues only?\\n\\nAlma 32:11\\n 11 Moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship\\nGod only once in a week?\\n\\nAlma 32:12\\n 12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your\\nsynagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom;\\nfor it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is\\nbecause that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your\\nbrethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought\\nto a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be\\nhumble.\\n\\nAlma 32:13\\n 13 And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are\\nye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh\\nrepentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy;\\nand he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall\\nbe saved.\\n\\nAlma 32:14\\n 14 And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled\\nto be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are\\nmore blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?\\n\\nAlma 32:15\\n 15 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his\\nsins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed--yea,\\nmuch more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble\\nbecause of their exceeding poverty.\\n\\nAlma 32:16\\n 16 Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without\\nbeing compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed\\nis he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without\\nstubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the\\nword, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.\\n\\nAlma 32:17\\n 17 Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a\\nsign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall\\nbelieve.\\n\\nAlma 32:18\\n 18 Now I ask, is this faith?  Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for\\nif a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he\\nknoweth it.\\n\\nAlma 32:19\\n 19 And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of\\nGod and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath\\ncause to believe, and falleth into transgression?\\n\\nAlma 32:20\\n 20 Now of this thing ye must judge.  Behold, I say unto you,\\nthat it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it\\nshall be unto every man according to his work.\\n\\nAlma 32:21\\n 21 And now as I said concerning faith--faith is not to have a\\nperfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope\\nfor things which are not seen, which are true.\\n\\nAlma 32:22\\n 22 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should\\nremember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name;\\ntherefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should\\nbelieve, yea, even on his word.\\n\\nAlma 32:23\\n 23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not\\nonly men but women also.  Now this is not all; little children do\\nhave words given unto them many times which confound the wise and\\nthe learned.\\n\\nAlma 32:24\\n 24 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of\\nme what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out--now I\\ndo not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you\\nonly according to that which is true--\\n\\nAlma 32:25\\n 25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to\\nhumble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among\\nyou who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever\\ncircumstances they might.\\n\\nAlma 32:26\\n 26 Now, as I said concerning faith--that it was not a perfect\\nknowledge--even so it is with my words.  Ye cannot know of their\\nsurety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a\\nperfect knowledge.\\n\\nAlma 32:27\\n 27 But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even\\nto an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith,\\nyea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this\\ndesire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can\\ngive place for a portion of my words.\\n\\nAlma 32:28\\n 28 Now, we will compare the word unto a seed.  Now, if ye give\\nplace, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be\\na true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your\\nunbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it\\nwill begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these\\nswelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves--It must\\nneeds be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for\\nit beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten\\nmy understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.\\n\\nAlma 32:29\\n 29 Now behold, would not this increase your faith?  I say unto\\nyou, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect\\nknowledge.\\n\\nAlma 32:30\\n 30 But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and\\nbeginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good;\\nfor behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. \\nAnd now behold, will not this strengthen your faith?  Yea, it\\nwill strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a\\ngood seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.\\n\\nAlma 32:31\\n 31 And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed?  I say\\nunto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own\\nlikeness.\\n\\nAlma 32:32\\n 32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth\\nnot, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.\\n\\nAlma 32:33\\n 33 And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and\\nplanted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to\\ngrow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.\\n\\nAlma 32:34\\n 34 And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect?  Yea, your\\nknowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant;\\nand this because ye know, for ye know that the word hath swelled\\nyour souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your\\nunderstanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth\\nbegin to expand.\\n\\nAlma 32:35\\n 35 O then, is not this real?  I say unto you, Yea, because it is\\nlight; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is\\ndiscernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now\\nbehold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge\\nperfect?\\n\\nAlma 32:36\\n 36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your\\nfaith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed\\nthat ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.\\n\\nAlma 32:37\\n 37 And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let\\nus nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may\\ngrow up, and bring forth fruit unto us.  And now behold, if ye\\nnourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and\\nbring forth fruit.\\n\\nAlma 32:38\\n 38 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its\\nnourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat\\nof the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it\\nwithers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.\\n\\nAlma 32:39\\n 39 Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it\\nbecause the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is\\nbecause your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree,\\ntherefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.\\n\\nAlma 32:40\\n 40 And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward\\nwith an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of\\nthe fruit of the tree of life.\\n\\nAlma 32:41\\n 41 But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it\\nbeginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with\\npatience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take\\nroot; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting\\nlife.\\n\\nAlma 32:42\\n 42 And because of your diligence and your faith and your\\npatience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in\\nyou, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is\\nmost precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which\\nis white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is\\npure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are\\nfilled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.\\n\\nAlma 32:43\\n 43 Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith,\\nand your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for\\nthe tree to bring forth fruit unto you.\\n\\nAlma 33\\nChapter 33\\n\\nAlma 33:1\\n 1 Now after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto\\nhim desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that\\nthey might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or how they\\nshould plant the seed, or the word of which he had spoken, which\\nhe said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they\\nshould begin to exercise their faith.\\n\\nAlma 33:2\\n 2 And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could\\nnot worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. \\nBut behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship\\nGod, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if\\nye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 33:3\\n 3 Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old,\\nhas said concerning prayer or worship?\\n\\nAlma 33:4\\n 4 For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my\\nprayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast\\nmerciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine enemies,\\nand thou didst turn them to me.\\n\\nAlma 33:5\\n 5 Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto\\nthee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou\\ndidst hear me.\\n\\nAlma 33:6\\n 6 And again, O God, when I did turn to my house thou didst hear\\nme in my prayer.\\n\\nAlma 33:7\\n 7 And when I did turn unto my closet, O Lord, and prayed unto\\nthee, thou didst hear me.\\n\\nAlma 33:8\\n 8 Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto\\nthee, to be heard of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 33:9\\n 9 Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my\\ncries in the midst of thy congregations.\\n\\nAlma 33:10\\n 10 Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out\\nand have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my\\ncries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit\\nthem in thine anger with speedy destruction.\\n\\nAlma 33:11\\n 11 And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my\\nsincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus\\nmerciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine\\nafflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy\\njudgments away from me, because of thy Son.\\n\\nAlma 33:12\\n 12 And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe those scriptures\\nwhich have been written by them of old?\\n\\nAlma 33:13\\n 13 Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for,\\nbehold he said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of\\nthy Son.\\n\\nAlma 33:14\\n 14 Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the\\nscriptures?  If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?\\n\\nAlma 33:15\\n 15 For it is not written that Zenos alone spake of these things,\\nbut Zenock also spake of these things--\\n\\nAlma 33:16\\n 16 For behold, he said: Thou art angry, O Lord, with this\\npeople, because they will not understand thy mercies which thou\\nhast bestowed upon them because of thy Son.\\n\\nAlma 33:17\\n 17 And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has\\ntestified of the Son of God, and because the people would not\\nunderstand his words they stoned him to death.\\n\\nAlma 33:18\\n 18 But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who\\nhave spoken concerning the Son of God.\\n\\nAlma 33:19\\n 19 Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was\\nraised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it\\nmight live.  And many did look and live.\\n\\nAlma 33:20\\n 20 But few understood the meaning of those things, and this\\nbecause of the hardness of their hearts.  But there were many who\\nwere so hardened that they would not look, therefore they\\nperished.  Now the reason they would not look is because they did\\nnot believe that it would heal them.\\n\\nAlma 33:21\\n 21 O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about\\nyour eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly,\\nor would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be\\nslothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might\\nperish?\\n\\nAlma 33:22\\n 22 If so, wo shall come upon you; but if not so, then cast about\\nyour eyes and begin to believe in the Son of God, that he will\\ncome to redeem his people, and that he shall suffer and die to\\natone for their sins; and that he shall rise again from the dead,\\nwhich shall bring to pass the resurrection, that all men shall\\nstand before him, to be judged at the last and judgment day,\\naccording to their works.\\n\\nAlma 33:23\\n 23 And now, my brethren, I desire that ye shall plant this word\\nin your hearts, and as it beginneth to swell even so nourish it\\nby your faith.  And behold, it will become a tree, springing up\\nin you unto everlasting life.  And then may God grant unto you\\nthat your burdens may be light, through the joy of his Son.  And\\neven all this can ye do if ye will.  Amen.\\n\\nAlma 34\\nChapter 34\\n\\nAlma 34:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words\\nunto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began\\nto teach them, saying:\\n\\nAlma 34:2\\n 2 My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be\\nignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the\\ncoming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea,\\nI know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before\\nyour dissension from among us.\\n\\nAlma 34:3\\n 3 And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should\\nmake known unto you what ye should do, because of your\\nafflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your\\nminds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience--\\n\\nAlma 34:4\\n 4 Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant\\nthe word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its\\ngoodness.\\n\\nAlma 34:5\\n 5 And we have beheld that the great question which is in your\\nminds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there\\nshall be no Christ.\\n\\nAlma 34:6\\n 6 And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in\\nmany instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.\\n\\nAlma 34:7\\n 7 My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption\\ncometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock;\\nand also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things\\nare true.\\n\\nAlma 34:8\\n 8 And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these\\nthings are true.  Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that\\nChrist shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the\\ntransgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the\\nsins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.\\n\\nAlma 34:9\\n 9 For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for\\naccording to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an\\natonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea,\\nall are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must\\nperish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient\\nshould be made.\\n\\nAlma 34:10\\n 10 For it is expedient that there should be a great and last\\nsacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither\\nof any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but\\nit must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.\\n\\nAlma 34:11\\n 11 Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood\\nwhich will atone for the sins of another.  Now, if a man\\nmurdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of\\nhis brother?  I say unto you, Nay.\\n\\nAlma 34:12\\n 12 But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered;\\ntherefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite\\natonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.\\n\\nAlma 34:13\\n 13 Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and\\nlast sacrifice; and then shall there be, or it is expedient there\\nshould be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of\\nMoses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and\\ntittle, and none shall have passed away.\\n\\nAlma 34:14\\n 14 And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit\\npointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and\\nlast sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.\\n\\nAlma 34:15\\n 15 And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall\\nbelieve on his name; this being the intent of this last\\nsacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth\\njustice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have\\nfaith unto repentance.\\n\\nAlma 34:16\\n 16 And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and\\nencircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no\\nfaith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands\\nof justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto\\nrepentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of\\nredemption.\\n\\nAlma 34:17\\n 17 Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may\\nbegin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to\\ncall upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;\\n\\nAlma 34:18\\n 18 Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.\\n\\nAlma 34:19\\n 19 Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.\\n\\nAlma 34:20\\n 20 Cry unto him when ye are in your fields, yea, over all your\\nflocks.\\n\\nAlma 34:21\\n 21 Cry unto him in your houses, yea, over all your household,\\nboth morning, mid-day, and evening.\\n\\nAlma 34:22\\n 22 Yea, cry unto him against the power of your enemies.\\n\\nAlma 34:23\\n 23 Yea, cry unto him against the devil, who is an enemy to all\\nrighteousness.\\n\\nAlma 34:24\\n 24 Cry unto him over the crops of your fields, that ye may\\nprosper in them.\\n\\nAlma 34:25\\n 25 Cry over the flocks of your fields, that they may increase.\\n\\nAlma 34:26\\n 26 But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your\\nclosets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 34:27\\n 27 Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts\\nbe full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your\\nwelfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.\\n\\nAlma 34:28\\n 28 And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not\\nsuppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these\\nthings, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not\\nthe sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have,\\nto those who stand in need--I say unto you, if ye do not any of\\nthese things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you\\nnothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.\\n\\nAlma 34:29\\n 29 Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as\\ndross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and\\nis trodden under foot of men.\\n\\nAlma 34:30\\n 30 And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so\\nmany witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these\\nthings, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance.\\n\\nAlma 34:31\\n 31 Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your\\nhearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of\\nyour salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not\\nyour hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be\\nbrought about unto you.\\n\\nAlma 34:32\\n 32 For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet\\nGod; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to\\nperform their labors.\\n\\nAlma 34:33\\n 33 And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many\\nwitnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not\\nprocrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after\\nthis day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity,\\nbehold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then\\ncometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor\\nperformed.\\n\\nAlma 34:34\\n 34 Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that\\nI will repent, that I will return to my God.  Nay, ye cannot say\\nthis; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the\\ntime that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have\\npower to possess your body in that eternal world.\\n\\nAlma 34:35\\n 35 For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your\\nrepentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to\\nthe spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the\\nSpirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in\\nyou, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final\\nstate of the wicked.\\n\\nAlma 34:36\\n 36 And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not\\nin unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he\\ndwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit\\ndown in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should\\nbe made white through the blood of the Lamb.\\n\\nAlma 34:37\\n 37 And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should\\nremember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation\\nwith fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming\\nof Christ;\\n\\nAlma 34:38\\n 38 That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye\\nreceive it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble\\nyourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place\\nye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in\\nthanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he\\ndoth bestow upon you.\\n\\nAlma 34:39\\n 39 Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful\\nunto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the\\ntemptations of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye\\nmay not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he\\nrewardeth you no good thing.\\n\\nAlma 34:40\\n 40 And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have\\npatience, and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that\\nye do not revile against those who do cast you out because of\\nyour exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;\\n\\nAlma 34:41\\n 41 But that ye have patience, and bear with those afflictions,\\nwith a firm hope that ye shall one day rest from all your\\nafflictions.\\n\\nAlma 35\\nChapter 35\\n\\nAlma 35:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that after Amulek had made an end of these\\nwords, they withdrew themselves from the multitude and came over\\ninto the land of Jershon.\\n\\nAlma 35:2\\n 2 Yea, and the rest of the brethren, after they had preached the\\nword unto the Zoramites, also came over into the land of Jershon.\\n\\nAlma 35:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the\\nZoramites had consulted together concerning the words which had\\nbeen preached unto them, they were angry because of the word, for\\nit did destroy their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto\\nthe words.\\n\\nAlma 35:4\\n 4 And they sent and gathered together throughout all the land\\nall the people, and consulted with them concerning the words\\nwhich had been spoken.\\n\\nAlma 35:5\\n 5 Now their rulers and their priests and their teachers did not\\nlet the people know concerning their desires; therefore they\\nfound out privily the minds of all the people.\\n\\nAlma 35:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of\\nall the people, those who were in favor of the words which had\\nbeen spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land;\\nand they were many; and they came over also into the land of\\nJershon.\\n\\nAlma 35:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that Alma and his brethren did minister\\nunto them.\\n\\nAlma 35:8\\n 8 Now the people of the Zoramites were angry with the people of\\nAmmon who were in Jershon, and the chief ruler of the Zoramites,\\nbeing a very wicked man, sent over unto the people of Ammon\\ndesiring them that they should cast out of their land all those\\nwho came over from them into their land.\\n\\nAlma 35:9\\n 9 And he breathed out many threatenings against them.  And now\\nthe people of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did\\nnot cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the\\nZoramites that came over unto them; and they did nourish them,\\nand did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their\\ninheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their\\nwants.\\n\\nAlma 35:10\\n 10 Now this did stir up the Zoramites to anger against the\\npeople of Ammon, and they began to mix with the Lamanites and to\\nstir them up also to anger against them.\\n\\nAlma 35:11\\n 11 And thus the Zoramites and the Lamanites began to make\\npreparations for war against the people of Ammon, and also\\nagainst the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 35:12\\n 12 And thus ended the seventeenth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 35:13\\n 13 And the people of Ammon departed out of the land of Jershon,\\nand came over into the land of Melek, and gave place in the land\\nof Jershon for the armies of the Nephites, that they might\\ncontend with the armies of the Lamanites and the armies of the\\nZoramites; and thus commenced a war betwixt the Lamanites and the\\nNephites, in the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges; and\\nan account shall be given of their wars hereafter.\\n\\nAlma 35:14\\n 14 And Alma, and Ammon, and their brethren, and also the two\\nsons of Alma returned to the land of Zarahemla, after having been\\ninstruments in the hands of God of bringing many of the Zoramites\\nto repentance; and as many as were brought to repentance were\\ndriven out of their land; but they have lands for their\\ninheritance in the land of Jershon, and they have taken up arms\\nto defend themselves, and their wives, and children, and their\\nlands.\\n\\nAlma 35:15\\n 15 Now Alma, being grieved for the iniquity of his people, yea\\nfor the wars, and the bloodsheds, and the contentions which were\\namong them; and having been to declare the word, or sent to\\ndeclare the word, among all the people in every city; and seeing\\nthat the hearts of the people began to wax hard, and that they\\nbegan to be offended because of the strictness of the word, his\\nheart was exceedingly sorrowful.\\n\\nAlma 35:16\\n 16 Therefore, he caused that his sons should be gathered\\ntogether, that he might give unto them every one his charge,\\nseparately, concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness. \\nAnd we have an account of his commandments, which he gave unto\\nthem according to his own record.\\n\\nAlma 36\\nChapter 36\\n\\nAlma 36:1\\n 1 My son, give ear to my words; for I swear unto you, that\\ninasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall\\nprosper in the land.\\n\\nAlma 36:2\\n 2 I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the\\ncaptivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none\\ncould deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and the God\\nof Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in\\ntheir afflictions.\\n\\nAlma 36:3\\n 3 And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and\\ntherefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and\\nlearn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust\\nin God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles,\\nand their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.\\n\\nAlma 36:4\\n 4 And I would not that ye think that I know of myself--not of\\nthe temporal but of the spiritual, not of the carnal mind but of\\nGod.\\n\\nAlma 36:5\\n 5 Now, behold, I say unto you, if I had not been born of God I\\nshould not have known these things; but God has, by the mouth of\\nhis holy angel, made these things known unto me, not of any\\nworthiness of myself.\\n\\nAlma 36:6\\n 6 For I went about with the sons of Mosiah, seeking to destroy\\nthe church of God; but behold, God sent his holy angel to stop us\\nby the way.\\n\\nAlma 36:7\\n 7 And behold, he spake unto us, as it were the voice of thunder,\\nand the whole earth did tremble beneath our feet; and we all fell\\nto the earth, for the fear of the Lord came upon us.\\n\\nAlma 36:8\\n 8 But behold, the voice said unto me: Arise.  And I arose and\\nstood up, and beheld the angel.\\n\\nAlma 36:9\\n 9 And he said unto me: If thou wilt of thyself be destroyed,\\nseek no more to destroy the church of God.\\n\\nAlma 36:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that I fell to the earth; and it was for\\nthe space of three days and three nights that I could not open my\\nmouth, neither had I the use of my limbs.\\n\\nAlma 36:11\\n 11 And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by\\nmy brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the\\nwords--If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to\\ndestroy the church of God--I was struck with such great fear and\\namazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the\\nearth and I did hear no more.\\n\\nAlma 36:12\\n 12 But I was racked with eternal torment, for my soul was\\nharrowed up to the greatest degree and racked with all my sins.\\n\\nAlma 36:13\\n 13 Yea, I did remember all my sins and iniquities, for which I\\nwas tormented with the pains of hell; yea, I saw that I had\\nrebelled against my God, and that I had not kept his holy\\ncommandments.\\n\\nAlma 36:14\\n 14 Yea, and I had murdered many of his children, or rather led\\nthem away unto destruction; yea, and in fine so great had been my\\niniquities, that the very thought of coming into the presence of\\nmy God did rack my soul with inexpressible horror.\\n\\nAlma 36:15\\n 15 Oh, thought I, that I could be banished and become extinct\\nboth soul and body, that I might not be brought to stand in the\\npresence of my God, to be judged of my deeds.\\n\\nAlma 36:16\\n 16 And now, for three days and for three nights was I racked,\\neven with the pains of a damned soul.\\n\\nAlma 36:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment,\\nwhile I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I\\nremembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people\\nconcerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone\\nfor the sins of the world.\\n\\nAlma 36:18\\n 18 Now, as my mind caught hold upon this thought, I cried within\\nmy heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me, who am in\\nthe gall of bitterness, and am encircled about by the everlasting\\nchains of death.\\n\\nAlma 36:19\\n 19 And now, behold, when I thought this, I could remember my\\npains no more; yea, I was harrowed up by the memory of my sins no\\nmore.\\n\\nAlma 36:20\\n 20 And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea,\\nmy soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!\\n\\nAlma 36:21\\n 21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so\\nexquisite and so bitter as were my pains.  Yea, and again I say\\nunto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so\\nexquisite and sweet as was my joy.\\n\\nAlma 36:22\\n 22 Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God\\nsitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of\\nangels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea,\\nand my soul did long to be there.\\n\\nAlma 36:23\\n 23 But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I\\nstood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had\\nbeen born of God.\\n\\nAlma 36:24\\n 24 Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored\\nwithout ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I\\nmight bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did\\ntaste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with\\nthe Holy Ghost.\\n\\nAlma 36:25\\n 25 Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me\\nexceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors;\\n\\nAlma 36:26\\n 26 For because of the word which he has imparted unto me,\\nbehold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have\\ntasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they\\ndo know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and\\nthe knowledge which I have is of God.\\n\\nAlma 36:27\\n 27 And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every\\nkind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has\\ndelivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea,\\nand I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me.\\n\\nAlma 36:28\\n 28 And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell\\nwith him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has\\nbrought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the\\nEgyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the\\npromised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of bondage and\\ncaptivity from time to time.\\n\\nAlma 36:29\\n 29 Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of\\nJerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, delivered\\nthem out of bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to\\nthe present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their\\ncaptivity; yea, and ye also ought to retain in remembrance, as I\\nhave done, their captivity.\\n\\nAlma 36:30\\n 30 But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as\\nI do know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God\\nye shall prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that\\ninasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be\\ncut off from his presence.  Now this is according to his word.\\n\\nAlma 37\\nChapter 37\\n\\nAlma 37:1\\n 1 And now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the\\nrecords which have been entrusted with me;\\n\\nAlma 37:2\\n 2 And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people,\\naccording as I have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all\\nthese things sacred which I have kept, even as I have kept them;\\nfor it is for a wise purpose that they are kept.\\n\\nAlma 37:3\\n 3 And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings,\\nwhich have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which\\nhave the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning--\\n\\nAlma 37:4\\n 4 Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they\\nshould be kept and handed down from one generation to another,\\nand be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they\\nshould go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,\\nthat they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.\\n\\nAlma 37:5\\n 5 And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their\\nbrightness; yea, and they will retain their brightness; yea, and\\nalso shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy\\nwrit.\\n\\nAlma 37:6\\n 6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold\\nI say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things\\nbrought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound\\nthe wise.\\n\\nAlma 37:7\\n 7 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great\\nand eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth\\nconfound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.\\n\\nAlma 37:8\\n 8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things\\nshould be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of\\nthis people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways,\\nand brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation\\nof their souls.\\n\\nAlma 37:9\\n 9 Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these\\nrecords do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his\\nbrethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the\\nLamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these\\nrecords and their words brought them unto repentance; that is,\\nthey brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to\\nrejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.\\n\\nAlma 37:10\\n 10 And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing\\nmany thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our\\nstiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their\\nhearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?\\n\\nAlma 37:11\\n 11 Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me;\\ntherefore I shall forbear.\\n\\nAlma 37:12\\n 12 And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a\\nwise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth\\ncounsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight,\\nand his course is one eternal round.\\n\\nAlma 37:13\\n 13 O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the\\ncommandments of God.  And he said: If ye will keep my\\ncommandments ye shall prosper in the land--but if ye keep not his\\ncommandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.\\n\\nAlma 37:14\\n 14 And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with\\nthese things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and\\nalso which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him,\\nthat he may show forth his power unto future generations.\\n\\nAlma 37:15\\n 15 And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if\\nye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which\\nare sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and\\nye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as\\nchaff before the wind.\\n\\nAlma 37:16\\n 16 But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these\\nthings which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth\\ncommand you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things\\nwhatsoever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or\\nhell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the\\nfulfilling of all his words.\\n\\nAlma 37:17\\n 17 For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto\\nyou, for he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our\\nfathers.\\n\\nAlma 37:18\\n 18 For he promised unto them that he would preserve these things\\nfor a wise purpose in him, that he might show forth his power\\nunto future generations.\\n\\nAlma 37:19\\n 19 And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the\\nrestoration of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge\\nof the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he\\nwill also still show forth his power in them unto future\\ngenerations; therefore they shall be preserved.\\n\\nAlma 37:20\\n 20 Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent\\nin fulfilling all my words, and that ye be diligent in keeping\\nthe commandments of God as they are written.\\n\\nAlma 37:21\\n 21 And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four\\nplates, that ye keep them, that the mysteries and the works of\\ndarkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those\\npeople who have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto this\\npeople; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their\\nplunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be\\nmade manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these\\ninterpreters.\\n\\nAlma 37:22\\n 22 For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in\\ndarkness, yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore\\nthe Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed\\nfrom off the face of the earth.\\n\\nAlma 37:23\\n 23 And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a\\nstone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may\\ndiscover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto\\nthem the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their\\nworks of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.\\n\\nAlma 37:24\\n 24 And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the\\nword of God might be fulfilled, which he spake, saying:\\n\\nAlma 37:25\\n 25 I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their\\nsecret works and their abominations; and except they repent I\\nwill destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will\\nbring to light all their secrets and abominations, unto every\\nnation that shall hereafter possess the land.\\n\\nAlma 37:26\\n 26 And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore\\nthey have been destroyed, and thus far the word of God has been\\nfulfilled; yea, their secret abominations have been brought out\\nof darkness and made known unto us.\\n\\nAlma 37:27\\n 27 And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their\\noaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret\\nabominations; yea, and all their signs and their wonders ye shall\\nkeep from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure\\nthey should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.\\n\\nAlma 37:28\\n 28 For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that\\ndestruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness,\\naccording to the power of God, when they are fully ripe;\\ntherefore I desire that this people might not be destroyed.\\n\\nAlma 37:29\\n 29 Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and\\ntheir covenants from this people, and only their wickedness and\\ntheir murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto\\nthem; and ye shall teach them to abhor such wickedness and\\nabominations and murders; and ye shall also teach them that these\\npeople were destroyed on account of their wickedness and\\nabominations and their murders.\\n\\nAlma 37:30\\n 30 For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who\\ncame among them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities;\\nand the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord\\ntheir God for vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and\\nthus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness\\nand secret combinations.\\n\\nAlma 37:31\\n 31 Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those\\nworkers of darkness and secret combinations, even unto\\ndestruction, except they repent before they are fully ripe.\\n\\nAlma 37:32\\n 32 And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto\\nyou; trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach\\nthem an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity.\\n\\nAlma 37:33\\n 33 Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus\\nChrist; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly\\nin heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil,\\nwith their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.\\n\\nAlma 37:34\\n 34 Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek\\nand lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.\\n\\nAlma 37:35\\n 35 O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea,\\nlearn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.\\n\\nAlma 37:36\\n 36 Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy\\ndoings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be\\nin the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord;\\nyea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord\\nforever.\\n\\nAlma 37:37\\n 37 Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct\\nthee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto\\nthe Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou\\nrisest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God;\\nand if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.\\n\\nAlma 37:38\\n 38 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing\\nwhich our fathers call a ball, or director--or our fathers called\\nit Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord\\nprepared it.\\n\\nAlma 37:39\\n 39 And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so\\ncurious a workmanship.  And behold, it was prepared to show unto\\nour fathers the course which they should travel in the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 37:40\\n 40 And it did work for them according to their faith in God;\\ntherefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that\\nthose spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it\\nwas done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other\\nmiracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.\\n\\nAlma 37:41\\n 41 Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small\\nmeans it did show unto them marvelous works.  They were slothful,\\nand forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those\\nmarvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their\\njourney;\\n\\nAlma 37:42\\n 42 Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel\\na direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst,\\nbecause of their transgressions.\\n\\nAlma 37:43\\n 43 And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these\\nthings are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful\\nto give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal)\\nthey did not prosper; even so it is with things which are\\nspiritual.\\n\\nAlma 37:44\\n 44 For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ,\\nwhich will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it\\nwas for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would\\npoint unto them a straight course to the promised land.\\n\\nAlma 37:45\\n 45 And now I say, is there not a type in this thing?  For just\\nas surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following\\nits course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if\\nwe follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into\\na far better land of promise.\\n\\nAlma 37:46\\n 46 O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness\\nof the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it\\nprepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even\\nso it is with us.  The way is prepared, and if we will look we\\nmay live forever.\\n\\nAlma 37:47\\n 47 And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred\\nthings, yea, see that ye look to God and live.  Go unto this\\npeople and declare the word, and be sober.  My son, farewell.\\n\\nAlma 38\\nChapter 38\\n\\nAlma 38:1\\n 1 My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I\\nsaid unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the\\ncommandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as\\nye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from\\nhis presence.\\n\\nAlma 38:2\\n 2 And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you,\\nbecause of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as\\nyou have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God,\\neven so I hope that you will continue in keeping his\\ncommandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.\\n\\nAlma 38:3\\n 3 I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee\\nalready, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy\\npatience and thy long-suffering among the people of the\\nZoramites.\\n\\nAlma 38:4\\n 4 For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that\\nthou wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all\\nthese things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and\\nnow thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.\\n\\nAlma 38:5\\n 5 And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that\\nas much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall\\nbe delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your\\nafflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.\\n\\nAlma 38:6\\n 6 Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know\\nthese things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in\\nme which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been\\nborn of God I should not have known these things.\\n\\nAlma 38:7\\n 7 But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to\\ndeclare unto me that I must stop the work of destruction among\\nhis people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he\\nspake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the\\nwhole earth.\\n\\nAlma 38:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in\\nthe most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did\\ncry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a\\nremission of my sins.  But behold, I did cry unto him and I did\\nfind peace to my soul.\\n\\nAlma 38:9\\n 9 And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn\\nwisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or\\nmeans whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. \\nBehold, he is the life and the light of the world.  Behold, he is\\nthe word of truth and righteousness.\\n\\nAlma 38:10\\n 10 And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would\\nthat ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be\\ndiligent and temperate in all things.\\n\\nAlma 38:11\\n 11 See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do\\nnot boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.\\n\\nAlma 38:12\\n 12 Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye\\nbridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see\\nthat ye refrain from idleness.\\n\\nAlma 38:13\\n 13 Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they\\npray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.\\n\\nAlma 38:14\\n 14 Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our\\nbrethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and\\nremember my brethren in mercy--yea, acknowledge your unworthiness\\nbefore God at all times.\\n\\nAlma 38:15\\n 15 And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last\\nday into his kingdom, to sit down in peace.  Now go, my son, and\\nteach the word unto this people.  Be sober.  My son, farewell.\\n\\nAlma 39\\nChapter 39\\n\\nAlma 39:1\\n 1 And now, my son, I have somewhat more to say unto thee than\\nwhat I said unto thy brother; for behold, have ye not observed\\nthe steadiness of thy brother, his faithfulness, and his\\ndiligence in keeping the commandments of God?  Behold, has he not\\nset a good example for thee?\\n\\nAlma 39:2\\n 2 For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy\\nbrother, among the people of the Zoramites.  Now this is what I\\nhave against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength\\nand thy wisdom.\\n\\nAlma 39:3\\n 3 And this is not all, my son.  Thou didst do that which was\\ngrievous unto me; for thou didst forsake the ministry, and did go\\nover into the land of Siron, among the borders of the Lamanites,\\nafter the harlot Isabel.\\n\\nAlma 39:4\\n 4 Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no\\nexcuse for thee, my son.  Thou shouldst have tended to the\\nministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.\\n\\nAlma 39:5\\n 5 Know ye not, my son, that these things are an abomination in\\nthe sight of the Lord; yea, most abominable above all sins save\\nit be the shedding of innocent blood or denying the Holy Ghost?\\n\\nAlma 39:6\\n 6 For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had\\nplace in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin\\nwhich is unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the\\nlight and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain\\nforgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for\\nhim to obtain a forgiveness.\\n\\nAlma 39:7\\n 7 And now, my son, I would to God that ye had not been guilty of\\nso great a crime.  I would not dwell upon your crimes, to harrow\\nup your soul, if it were not for your good.\\n\\nAlma 39:8\\n 8 But behold, ye cannot hide your crimes from God; and except ye\\nrepent they will stand as a testimony against you at the last\\nday.\\n\\nAlma 39:9\\n 9 Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your\\nsins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross\\nyourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in\\nnowise inherit the kingdom of God.  Oh, remember, and take it\\nupon you, and cross yourself in these things.\\n\\nAlma 39:10\\n 10 And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your\\nelder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy\\nyouth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. \\nAnd give heed to their counsel.\\n\\nAlma 39:11\\n 11 Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish\\nthing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after\\nthose wicked harlots.  Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye\\nbrought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they\\nwould not believe in my words.\\n\\nAlma 39:12\\n 12 And now the Spirit of the Lord doth say unto me: Command thy\\nchildren to do good, lest they lead away the hearts of many\\npeople to destruction; therefore I command you, my son, in the\\nfear of God, that ye refrain from your iniquities;\\n\\nAlma 39:13\\n 13 That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and\\nstrength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly;\\nbut rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that\\nwrong which ye have done.\\n\\nAlma 39:14\\n 14 Seek not after riches nor the vain things of this world; for\\nbehold, you cannot carry them with you.\\n\\nAlma 39:15\\n 15 And now, my son, I would say somewhat unto you concerning the\\ncoming of Christ.  Behold, I say unto you, that it is he that\\nsurely shall come to take away the sins of the world; yea, he\\ncometh to declare glad tidings of salvation unto his people.\\n\\nAlma 39:16\\n 16 And now, my son, this was the ministry unto which ye were\\ncalled, to declare these glad tidings unto this people to prepare\\ntheir minds; or rather that salvation might come unto them, that\\nthey may prepare the minds of their children to hear the word at\\nthe time of his coming.\\n\\nAlma 39:17\\n 17 And now I will ease your mind somewhat on this subject. \\nBehold, you marvel why these things should be known so long\\nbeforehand.  Behold, I say unto you, is not a soul at this time\\nas precious unto God as a soul will be at the time of his coming?\\n\\nAlma 39:18\\n 18 Is it not as necessary that the plan of redemption should be\\nmade known unto this people as well as unto their children?\\n\\nAlma 39:19\\n 19 Is it not as easy at this time for the Lord to send his angel\\nto declare these glad tidings unto us as unto our children, or as\\nafter the time of his coming?\\n\\nAlma 40\\nChapter 40\\n\\nAlma 40:1\\n 1 Now my son, here is somewhat more I would say unto thee; for I\\nperceive that thy mind is worried concerning the resurrection of\\nthe dead.\\n\\nAlma 40:2\\n 2 Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection--or, I\\nwould say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on\\nimmortality, this corruption does not put on incorruption--until\\nafter the coming of Christ.\\n\\nAlma 40:3\\n 3 Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.  But\\nbehold, my son, the resurrection is not yet.  Now, I unfold unto\\nyou a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are\\nkept, that no one knoweth them save God himself.  But I show unto\\nyou one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I\\nmight know--that is concerning the resurrection.\\n\\nAlma 40:4\\n 4 Behold, there is a time appointed that all shall come forth\\nfrom the dead.  Now when this time cometh no one knows; but God\\nknoweth the time which is appointed.\\n\\nAlma 40:5\\n 5 Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a\\nthird time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth\\nnot; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to\\nknow that this is the case--that there is a time appointed that\\nall shall rise from the dead.\\n\\nAlma 40:6\\n 6 Now there must needs be a space betwixt the time of death and\\nthe time of the resurrection.\\n\\nAlma 40:7\\n 7 And now I would inquire what becometh of the souls of men from\\nthis time of death to the time appointed for the resurrection?\\n\\nAlma 40:8\\n 8 Now whether there is more than one time appointed for men to\\nrise it mattereth not; for all do not die at once, and this\\nmattereth not; all is as one day with God, and time only is\\nmeasured unto men.\\n\\nAlma 40:9\\n 9 Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall\\nrise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of\\ndeath and the resurrection.  And now, concerning this space of\\ntime, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have\\ninquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of\\nwhich I do know.\\n\\nAlma 40:10\\n 10 And when the time cometh when all shall rise, then shall they\\nknow that God knoweth all the times which are appointed unto man.\\n\\nAlma 40:11\\n 11 Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the\\nresurrection--Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel,\\nthat the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from\\nthis mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be\\ngood or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.\\n\\nAlma 40:12\\n 12 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who\\nare righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is\\ncalled paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they\\nshall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.\\n\\nAlma 40:13\\n 13 And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the\\nwicked, yea, who are evil--for behold, they have no part nor\\nportion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil\\nworks rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did\\nenter into them, and take possession of their house--and these\\nshall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping,\\nand wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own\\niniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.\\n\\nAlma 40:14\\n 14 Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in\\ndarkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery\\nindignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in\\nthis state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time\\nof their resurrection.\\n\\nAlma 40:15\\n 15 Now, there are some that have understood that this state of\\nhappiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the\\nresurrection, was a first resurrection.  Yea, I admit it may be\\ntermed a resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and\\ntheir consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words\\nwhich have been spoken.\\n\\nAlma 40:16\\n 16 And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first\\nresurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who\\nare, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the\\ndead.\\n\\nAlma 40:17\\n 17 Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is\\nspoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls\\nand their consignation to happiness or misery.  Ye cannot suppose\\nthat this is what it meaneth.\\n\\nAlma 40:18\\n 18 Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of\\nthe soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to\\nthe resurrection of Christ.\\n\\nAlma 40:19\\n 19 Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has\\nbeen spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as\\nthe righteous, I do not say; let it suffice; that I say that they\\nall come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to\\npass before the resurrection of those who die after the\\nresurrection of Christ.\\n\\nAlma 40:20\\n 20 Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at\\nthe resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion,\\nthat the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at\\nthe resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven.\\n\\nAlma 40:21\\n 21 But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say;\\nbut this much I say, that there is a space between death and the\\nresurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or\\nin misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead\\nshall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be\\nbrought to stand before God, and be judged according to their\\nworks.\\n\\nAlma 40:22\\n 22 Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of\\nwhich has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.\\n\\nAlma 40:23\\n 23 The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the\\nsoul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its\\nbody; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all\\nthings shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.\\n\\nAlma 40:24\\n 24 And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been\\nspoken by the mouths of the prophets--\\n\\nAlma 40:25\\n 25 And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of\\nGod.\\n\\nAlma 40:26\\n 26 But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they\\ndie as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they\\nare unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God;\\nbut they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of\\ntheir labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink\\nthe dregs of a bitter cup.\\n\\nAlma 41\\nChapter 41\\n\\nAlma 41:1\\n 1 And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the\\nrestoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have\\nwrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this\\nthing.  And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also\\nconcerning this thing.  But behold, I will explain it unto thee.\\n\\nAlma 41:2\\n 2 I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is\\nrequisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all\\nthings should be restored to their proper order.  Behold, it is\\nrequisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of\\nChrist, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and\\nthat every part of the body should be restored to itself.\\n\\nAlma 41:3\\n 3 And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be\\njudged according to their works; and if their works were good in\\nthis life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they\\nshould also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is\\ngood.\\n\\nAlma 41:4\\n 4 And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them\\nfor evil.  Therefore, all things shall be restored to their\\nproper order, every thing to its natural frame--mortality raised\\nto immortality, corruption to incorruption--raised to endless\\nhappiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to\\ninherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other\\non the other--\\n\\nAlma 41:5\\n 5 The one raised to happiness according to his desires of\\nhappiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the\\nother to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has\\ndesired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his\\nreward of evil when the night cometh.\\n\\nAlma 41:6\\n 6 And so it is on the other hand.  If he hath repented of his\\nsins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even\\nso he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.\\n\\nAlma 41:7\\n 7 These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are\\nthey that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless\\nnight of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they\\nare their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.\\n\\nAlma 41:8\\n 8 Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is\\nprepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.\\n\\nAlma 41:9\\n 9 And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against\\nyour God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto\\nrisked to commit sin.\\n\\nAlma 41:10\\n 10 Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning\\nrestoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. \\nBehold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.\\n\\nAlma 41:11\\n 11 And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I\\nwould say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and\\nin the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and\\nthey have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are\\nin a state contrary to the nature of happiness.\\n\\nAlma 41:12\\n 12 And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to\\ntake a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural\\nstate, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?\\n\\nAlma 41:13\\n 13 O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word\\nrestoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for\\ncarnal, or devilish for devilish--good for that which is good;\\nrighteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is\\njust; merciful for that which is merciful.\\n\\nAlma 41:14\\n 14 Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your\\nbrethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good\\ncontinually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive\\nyour reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye\\nshall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a\\nrighteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have\\ngood rewarded unto you again.\\n\\nAlma 41:15\\n 15 For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again,\\nand be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully\\ncondemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.\\n\\nAlma 42\\nChapter 42\\n\\nAlma 42:1\\n 1 And now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth\\nworry your mind, which ye cannot understand--which is concerning\\nthe justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try\\nto suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be\\nconsigned to a state of misery.\\n\\nAlma 42:2\\n 2 Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee.  For\\nbehold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the\\ngarden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were\\ntaken--yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of\\nthe garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned\\nevery way, to keep the tree of life--\\n\\nAlma 42:3\\n 3 Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and\\nevil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the\\ntree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed\\ncherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the\\nfruit--\\n\\nAlma 42:4\\n 4 And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to\\nrepent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.\\n\\nAlma 42:5\\n 5 For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and\\npartaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever,\\naccording to the word of God, having no space for repentance;\\nyea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great\\nplan of salvation would have been frustrated.\\n\\nAlma 42:6\\n 6 But behold, it was appointed unto man to die--therefore, as\\nthey were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off\\nfrom the face of the earth--and man became lost forever, yea,\\nthey became fallen man.\\n\\nAlma 42:7\\n 7 And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off\\nboth temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord;\\nand thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own\\nwill.\\n\\nAlma 42:8\\n 8 Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed\\nfrom this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan\\nof happiness.\\n\\nAlma 42:9\\n 9 Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had\\nbrought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal,\\nthat is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was\\nexpedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual\\ndeath.\\n\\nAlma 42:10\\n 10 Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish,\\nby nature, this probationary state became a state for them to\\nprepare; it became a preparatory state.\\n\\nAlma 42:11\\n 11 And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of\\nredemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their\\nsouls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the\\nLord.\\n\\nAlma 42:12\\n 12 And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen\\nstate, which man had brought upon himself because of his own\\ndisobedience;\\n\\nAlma 42:13\\n 13 Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could\\nnot be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in\\nthis probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except\\nit were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except\\nit should destroy the work of justice.  Now the work of justice\\ncould not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.\\n\\nAlma 42:14\\n 14 And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were\\nin the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned\\nthem forever to be cut off from his presence.\\n\\nAlma 42:15\\n 15 And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except\\nan atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for\\nthe sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to\\nappease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just\\nGod, and a merciful God also.\\n\\nAlma 42:16\\n 16 Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a\\npunishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should\\nbe, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as\\neternal also as the life of the soul.\\n\\nAlma 42:17\\n 17 Now, how could a man repent except he should sin?  How could\\nhe sin if there was no law?  How could there be a law save there\\nwas a punishment?\\n\\nAlma 42:18\\n 18 Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given,\\nwhich brought remorse of conscience unto man.\\n\\nAlma 42:19\\n 19 Now, if there was no law given--if a man murdered he should\\ndie--would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?\\n\\nAlma 42:20\\n 20 And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not\\nbe afraid to sin.\\n\\nAlma 42:21\\n 21 And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could\\njustice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon\\nthe creature?\\n\\nAlma 42:22\\n 22 But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a\\nrepentance granted; which repentance mercy claimeth; otherwise,\\njustice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law\\ninflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would\\nbe destroyed, and God would cease to be God.\\n\\nAlma 42:23\\n 23 But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the\\npenitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the\\natonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the\\nresurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of\\nGod; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged\\naccording to their works, according to the law and justice.\\n\\nAlma 42:24\\n 24 For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also\\nmercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly\\npenitent are saved.\\n\\nAlma 42:25\\n 25 What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice?  I say unto\\nyou, Nay; not one whit.  If so, God would cease to be God.\\n\\nAlma 42:26\\n 26 And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes,\\nwhich were prepared from the foundation of the world.  And thus\\ncometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also\\ntheir destruction and misery.\\n\\nAlma 42:27\\n 27 Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake\\nof the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the\\nsame is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be\\nrestored unto him according to his deeds.\\n\\nAlma 42:28\\n 28 If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his\\ndays, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the\\nrestoration of God.\\n\\nAlma 42:29\\n 29 And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things\\ntrouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with\\nthat trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.\\n\\nAlma 42:30\\n 30 O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no\\nmore.  Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point\\nbecause of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you\\nlet the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering\\nhave full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the\\ndust in humility.\\n\\nAlma 42:31\\n 31 And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word\\nunto this people.  And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word\\nwith truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto\\nrepentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon\\nthem.  And may God grant unto you even according to my words. \\nAmen.\\n\\nAlma 43\\nChapter 43\\n\\nAlma 43:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth\\namong the people, to declare the word unto them.  And Alma, also,\\nhimself, could not rest, and he also went forth.\\n\\nAlma 43:2\\n 2 Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except\\nthat they preached the word, and the truth, according to the\\nspirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the\\nholy order of God by which they were called.\\n\\nAlma 43:3\\n 3 And now I return to an account of the wars between the\\nNephites and the Lamanites, in the eighteenth year of the reign\\nof the judges.\\n\\nAlma 43:4\\n 4 For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became\\nLamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year\\nthe people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming\\nupon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they\\ngathered together their armies in the land of Jershon.\\n\\nAlma 43:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their\\nthousands; and they came into the land of Antionum, which is the\\nland of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was\\ntheir leader.\\n\\nAlma 43:6\\n 6 And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous\\ndisposition than the Lamanites were, in and of themselves,\\ntherefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the\\nLamanites, and they were all Amalekites and Zoramites.\\n\\nAlma 43:7\\n 7 Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards\\nthe Nephites, that he might bring them into subjection to the\\naccomplishment of his designs.\\n\\nAlma 43:8\\n 8 For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger\\nagainst the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power\\nover them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by\\nbringing them into bondage.\\n\\nAlma 43:9\\n 9 And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands,\\nand their houses, and their wives, and their children, that they\\nmight preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also\\nthat they might preserve their rights and their privileges, yea,\\nand also their liberty, that they might worship God according to\\ntheir desires.\\n\\nAlma 43:10\\n 10 For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the\\nLamanites, that whosoever should worship God in spirit and in\\ntruth, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy.\\n\\nAlma 43:11\\n 11 Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites\\ntowards their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi,\\nwho were called the people of Ammon--and they would not take up\\narms, yea, they had entered into a covenant and they would not\\nbreak it--therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the\\nLamanites they would be destroyed.\\n\\nAlma 43:12\\n 12 And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be\\ndestroyed; therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance.\\n\\nAlma 43:13\\n 13 And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large\\nportion of their substance to support their armies; and thus the\\nNephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the\\nLamanites, who were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons\\nof Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from the Nephites,\\nwho were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the descendants of the\\npriests of Noah.\\n\\nAlma 43:14\\n 14 Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the\\nNephites; and thus the Nephites were obliged to contend with\\ntheir brethren, even unto bloodshed.\\n\\nAlma 43:15\\n 15 And it came to pass as the armies of the Lamanites had\\ngathered together in the land of Antionum, behold, the armies of\\nthe Nephites were prepared to meet them in the land of Jershon.\\n\\nAlma 43:16\\n 16 Now, the leader of the Nephites, or the man who had been\\nappointed to be the chief captain over the Nephites--now the\\nchief captain took the command of all the armies of the\\nNephites--and his name was Moroni;\\n\\nAlma 43:17\\n 17 And Moroni took all the command, and the government of their\\nwars.  And he was only twenty and five years old when he was\\nappointed chief captain over the armies of the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 43:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that he met the Lamanites in the borders\\nof Jershon, and his people were armed with swords, and with\\ncimeters, and all manner of weapons of war.\\n\\nAlma 43:19\\n 19 And when the armies of the Lamanites saw that the people of\\nNephi, or that Moroni, had prepared his people with breastplates\\nand with arm-shields, yea, and also shields to defend their\\nheads, and also they were dressed with thick clothing--\\n\\nAlma 43:20\\n 20 Now the army of Zerahemnah was not prepared with any such\\nthing; they had only their swords and their cimeters, their bows\\nand their arrows, their stones and their slings; and they were\\nnaked, save it were a skin which was girded about their loins;\\nyea, all were naked, save it were the Zoramites and the\\nAmalekites;\\n\\nAlma 43:21\\n 21 But they were not armed with breastplates, nor\\nshields--therefore, they were exceedingly afraid of the armies of\\nthe Nephites because of their armor, notwithstanding their number\\nbeing so much greater than the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 43:22\\n 22 Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against\\nthe Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed\\nout of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their\\njourney round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the\\nriver Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti and take\\npossession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies\\nof Moroni would know whither they had gone.\\n\\nAlma 43:23\\n 23 But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the\\nwilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their\\ncamp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent\\ncertain men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the\\nLord whither the armies of the Nephites should go to defend\\nthemselves against the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 43:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma,\\nand Alma informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of\\nthe Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, that\\nthey might come over into the land of Manti, that they might\\ncommence an attack upon the weaker part of the people.  And those\\nmessengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 43:25\\n 25 Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of\\nJershon, lest by any means a part of the Lamanites should come\\ninto that land and take possession of the city, took the\\nremaining part of his army and marched over into the land of\\nManti.\\n\\nAlma 43:26\\n 26 And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land\\nshould gather themselves together to battle against the\\nLamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights\\nand their liberties; therefore they were prepared against the\\ntime of the coming of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 43:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his army should\\nbe secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river\\nSidon, which was on the west of the river Sidon in the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 43:28\\n 28 And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when\\nthe camp of the Lamanites should come.\\n\\nAlma 43:29\\n 29 And now, as Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites, that\\nit was their intention to destroy their brethren, or to subject\\nthem and bring them into bondage that they might establish a\\nkingdom unto themselves over all the land;\\n\\nAlma 43:30\\n 30 And he also knowing that it was the only desire of the\\nNephites to preserve their lands, and their liberty, and their\\nchurch, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them\\nby stratagem; therefore, he found by his spies which course the\\nLamanites were to take.\\n\\nAlma 43:31\\n 31 Therefore, he divided his army and brought a part over into\\nthe valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of\\nthe hill Riplah;\\n\\nAlma 43:32\\n 32 And the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the\\nwest of the river Sidon, and so down into the borders of the land\\nManti.\\n\\nAlma 43:33\\n 33 And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he\\nwas prepared to meet them.\\n\\nAlma 43:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on the north\\nof the hill, where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed.\\n\\nAlma 43:35\\n 35 And as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came\\ninto the valley, and began to cross the river Sidon, the army\\nwhich was concealed on the south of the hill, which was led by a\\nman whose name was Lehi, and he led his army forth and encircled\\nthe Lamanites about on the east in their rear.\\n\\nAlma 43:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the\\nNephites coming upon them in their rear, turned them about and\\nbegan to contend with the army of Lehi.\\n\\nAlma 43:37\\n 37 And the work of death commenced on both sides, but it was\\nmore dreadful on the part of the Lamanites, for their nakedness\\nwas exposed to the heavy blows of the Nephites with their swords\\nand their cimeters, which brought death almost at every stroke.\\n\\nAlma 43:38\\n 38 While on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell\\namong the Nephites, by their swords and the loss of blood, they\\nbeing shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more\\nvital parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of the\\nLamanites, by their breastplates, and their arm-shields, and\\ntheir head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of\\ndeath among the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 43:39\\n 39 And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened,\\nbecause of the great destruction among them, even until they\\nbegan to flee towards the river Sidon.\\n\\nAlma 43:40\\n 40 And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were\\ndriven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the\\nwaters of Sidon.  And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of\\nthe river Sidon that they should not cross.\\n\\nAlma 43:41\\n 41 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army met the\\nLamanites in the valley, on the other side of the river Sidon,\\nand began to fall upon them and to slay them.\\n\\nAlma 43:42\\n 42 And the Lamanites did flee again before them, towards the\\nland of Manti; and they were met again by the armies of Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 43:43\\n 43 Now in this case the Lamanites did fight exceedingly; yea,\\nnever had the Lamanites been known to fight with such exceedingly\\ngreat strength and courage, no, not even from the beginning.\\n\\nAlma 43:44\\n 44 And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites,\\nwho were their chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who\\nwas their chief captain, or their chief leader and commander;\\nyea, they did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites were\\nslain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in two many of\\ntheir head-plates, and they did pierce many of their\\nbreastplates, and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus\\nthe Lamanites did smite in their fierce anger.\\n\\nAlma 43:45\\n 45 Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause,\\nfor they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were\\nfighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and\\ntheir children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship\\nand their church.\\n\\nAlma 43:46\\n 46 And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which\\nthey owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also\\nunto their fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the\\nfirst offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves\\nto be slain by the hands of your enemies.\\n\\nAlma 43:47\\n 47 And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your\\nfamilies even unto bloodshed.  Therefore for this cause were the\\nNephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and\\ntheir families, and their lands, their country, and their rights,\\nand their religion.\\n\\nAlma 43:48\\n 48 And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the\\nfierceness and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to\\nshrink and flee from them.  And Moroni, perceiving their intent,\\nsent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts--yea,\\nthe thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom\\nfrom bondage.\\n\\nAlma 43:49\\n 49 And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and\\nthey cried with one voice unto the Lord their God, for their\\nliberty and their freedom from bondage.\\n\\nAlma 43:50\\n 50 And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and\\nin that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their\\nfreedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled\\neven to the waters of Sidon.\\n\\nAlma 43:51\\n 51 Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than\\ndouble the number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven\\ninsomuch that they were gathered together in one body in the\\nvalley, upon the bank by the river Sidon.\\n\\nAlma 43:52\\n 52 Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea,\\neven on both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the\\nmen of Lehi.\\n\\nAlma 43:53\\n 53 Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of\\nthe river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the\\nriver Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they\\nwere struck with terror.\\n\\nAlma 43:54\\n 54 Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that\\nthey should stop shedding their blood.\\n\\nAlma 44\\nChapter 44\\n\\nAlma 44:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace\\nfrom them.  And Moroni said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah,\\nthat we do not desire to be men of blood.  Ye know that ye are in\\nour hands, yet we do not desire to slay you.\\n\\nAlma 44:2\\n 2 Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we\\nmight shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring\\nany one to the yoke of bondage.  But this is the very cause for\\nwhich ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us\\nbecause of our religion.\\n\\nAlma 44:3\\n 3 But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold\\nthat he has delivered you into our hands.  And now I would that\\nye should understand that this is done unto us because of our\\nreligion and our faith in Christ.  And now ye see that ye cannot\\ndestroy this our faith.\\n\\nAlma 44:4\\n 4 Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see\\nthat God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we\\nare faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and\\nnever will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we\\nshould fall into transgression and deny our faith.\\n\\nAlma 44:5\\n 5 And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that\\nall-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have\\ngained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our\\nrites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support\\nwhich we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which\\nbinds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the\\nmaintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our\\nhappiness; and by all that is most dear unto us--\\n\\nAlma 44:6\\n 6 Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires\\nwhich ye have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war\\nunto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your\\nlives, if ye will go your way and come not again to war against\\nus.\\n\\nAlma 44:7\\n 7 And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I\\nwill command my men that they shall fall upon you, and inflict\\nthe wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct;\\nand then we will see who shall have power over this people; yea,\\nwe will see who shall be brought into bondage.\\n\\nAlma 44:8\\n 8 And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these\\nsayings he came forth and delivered up his sword and his cimeter,\\nand his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold,\\nhere are our weapons of war; we will deliver them up unto you,\\nbut we will not suffer ourselves to take an oath unto you, which\\nwe know that we shall break, and also our children; but take our\\nweapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the\\nwilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will\\nperish or conquer.\\n\\nAlma 44:9\\n 9 Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is\\nGod that has delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it\\nis your cunning that has preserved you from our swords.  Behold,\\nit is your breastplates and your shields that have preserved you.\\n\\nAlma 44:10\\n 10 And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these\\nwords, Moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war, which he\\nhad received, unto Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the\\nconflict.\\n\\nAlma 44:11\\n 11 Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore\\nas the Lord liveth, ye shall not depart except ye depart with an\\noath that ye will not return again against us to war.  Now as ye\\nare in our hands we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye\\nshall submit to the conditions which I have proposed.\\n\\nAlma 44:12\\n 12 And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained\\nhis sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward\\nthat he might slay Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold,\\none of Moroni's soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke\\nby the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah that he took off his\\nscalp and it fell to the earth.  And Zerahemnah withdrew from\\nbefore them into the midst of his soldiers.\\n\\nAlma 44:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote\\noff the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the\\nground by the hair, and laid it upon the point of his sword, and\\nstretched it forth unto them, saying unto them with a loud voice:\\n\\nAlma 44:14\\n 14 Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the\\nscalp of your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will\\ndeliver up your weapons of war and depart with a covenant of\\npeace.\\n\\nAlma 44:15\\n 15 Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the\\nscalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and\\nmany came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet\\nof Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace.  And as many as\\nentered into a covenant they suffered to depart into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 44:16\\n 16 Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth,\\nand he did stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger, to\\ncontend more powerfully against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 44:17\\n 17 And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the\\nLamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they should\\nfall upon them and slay them.  And it came to pass that they\\nbegan to slay them; yea, and the Lamanites did contend with their\\nswords and their might.\\n\\nAlma 44:18\\n 18 But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were\\nexposed to the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold they\\nwere pierced and smitten, yea, and did fall exceedingly fast\\nbefore the swords of the Nephites; and they began to be swept\\ndown, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied.\\n\\nAlma 44:19\\n 19 Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be\\ndestroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would\\ncovenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the\\nremainder of their lives, that they never would come to war again\\nagainst them.\\n\\nAlma 44:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death\\nshould cease again among the people.  And he took the weapons of\\nwar from the Lamanites; and after they had entered into a\\ncovenant with him of peace they were suffered to depart into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 44:21\\n 21 Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the\\ngreatness of the number; yea, the number of their dead was\\nexceedingly great, both on the Nephites and on the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 44:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the\\nwaters of Sidon, and they have gone forth and are buried in the\\ndepths of the sea.\\n\\nAlma 44:23\\n 23 And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni, returned and\\ncame to their houses and their lands.\\n\\nAlma 44:24\\n 24 And thus ended the eighteenth year of the reign of the judges\\nover the people of Nephi.  And thus ended the record of Alma,\\nwhich was written upon the plates of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 45\\nChapter 45\\n\\nAlma 45:1\\n 1 Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were\\nexceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them\\nout of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks\\nunto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray\\nmuch, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.\\n\\nAlma 45:2\\n 2 And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son\\nHelaman and said unto him: Believest thou the words which I spake\\nunto thee concerning those records which have been kept?\\n\\nAlma 45:3\\n 3 And Helaman said unto him: Yea, I believe.\\n\\nAlma 45:4\\n 4 And Alma said again: Believest thou in Jesus Christ, who shall\\ncome?\\n\\nAlma 45:5\\n 5 And he said: Yea, I believe all the words which thou hast\\nspoken.\\n\\nAlma 45:6\\n 6 And Alma said unto him again: Will ye keep my commandments?\\n\\nAlma 45:7\\n 7 And he said: Yea, I will keep thy commandments with all my\\nheart.\\n\\nAlma 45:8\\n 8 Then Alma said unto him: Blessed art thou; and the Lord shall\\nprosper thee in this land.\\n\\nAlma 45:9\\n 9 But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but what I\\nprophesy unto thee ye shall not make known; yea, what I prophesy\\nunto thee shall not be made known, even until the prophecy is\\nfulfilled; therefore write the words which I shall say.\\n\\nAlma 45:10\\n 10 And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very\\npeople, the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation which\\nis in me, in four hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ\\nshall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief.\\n\\nAlma 45:11\\n 11 Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea,\\nfamines and bloodshed, even until the people of Nephi shall\\nbecome extinct--\\n\\nAlma 45:12\\n 12 Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall\\ninto the works of darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of\\niniquities; yea, I say unto you, that because they shall sin\\nagainst so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that\\nfrom that day, even the fourth generation shall not all pass away\\nbefore this great iniquity shall come.\\n\\nAlma 45:13\\n 13 And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon\\ncometh that those who are now, or the seed of those who are now\\nnumbered among the people of Nephi, shall no more be numbered\\namong the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 45:14\\n 14 But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great\\nand dreadful day, shall be numbered among the Lamanites, and\\nshall become like unto them, all, save it be a few who shall be\\ncalled the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the Lamanites\\npursue even until they shall become extinct.  And now, because of\\niniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.\\n\\nAlma 45:15\\n 15 And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things\\nto Helaman, he blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also\\nblessed the earth for the righteous' sake.\\n\\nAlma 45:16\\n 16 And he said: Thus saith the Lord God--Cursed shall be the\\nland, yea, this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and\\npeople, unto destruction, which do wickedly, when they are fully\\nripe; and as I have said so shall it be; for this is the cursing\\nand the blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot look\\nupon sin with the least degree of allowance.\\n\\nAlma 45:17\\n 17 And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the\\nchurch, yea, all those who should stand fast in the faith from\\nthat time henceforth.\\n\\nAlma 45:18\\n 18 And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of\\nZarahemla, as if to go into the land of Melek.  And it came to\\npass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial\\nwe know not of.\\n\\nAlma 45:19\\n 19 Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the\\nsaying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the\\nSpirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses.  But\\nbehold, the scriptures saith the Lord took Moses unto himself;\\nand we suppose that he has also received Alma in the spirit, unto\\nhimself; therefore, for this cause we know nothing concerning his\\ndeath and burial.\\n\\nAlma 45:20\\n 20 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the nineteenth\\nyear of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that\\nHelaman went forth among the people to declare the word unto\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 45:21\\n 21 For behold, because of their wars with the Lamanites and the\\nmany little dissensions and disturbances which had been among the\\npeople, it became expedient that the word of God should be\\ndeclared among them, yea, and that a regulation should be made\\nthroughout the church.\\n\\nAlma 45:22\\n 22 Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish\\nthe church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout\\nall the land which was possessed by the people of Nephi.  And it\\ncame to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers\\nthroughout all the land, over all the churches.\\n\\nAlma 45:23\\n 23 And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren\\nhad appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there\\narose a dissension among them, and they would not give heed to\\nthe words of Helaman and his brethren;\\n\\nAlma 45:24\\n 24 But they grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because\\nof their exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in\\ntheir own eyes, and would not give heed to their words, to walk\\nuprightly before God.\\n\\nAlma 46\\nChapter 46\\n\\nAlma 46:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that as many as would not hearken to the\\nwords of Helaman and his brethren were gathered together against\\ntheir brethren.\\n\\nAlma 46:2\\n 2 And now behold, they were exceedingly wroth, insomuch that\\nthey were determined to slay them.\\n\\nAlma 46:3\\n 3 Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren\\nwas a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.\\n\\nAlma 46:4\\n 4 And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who\\nwere wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and\\nthey were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land,\\nand they were seeking for power.\\n\\nAlma 46:5\\n 5 And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if\\nthey would support him and establish him to be their king that he\\nwould make them rulers over the people.\\n\\nAlma 46:6\\n 6 Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions,\\nnotwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea,\\nnotwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for\\nthey were high priests over the church.\\n\\nAlma 46:7\\n 7 And there were many in the church who believed in the\\nflattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even\\nfrom the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi\\nexceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great\\nvictory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great\\nrejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the\\nhand of the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 46:8\\n 8 Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord\\ntheir God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by\\nthe evil one.\\n\\nAlma 46:9\\n 9 Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man\\ncan cause to take place among the children of men.\\n\\nAlma 46:10\\n 10 Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning\\ndevice and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the\\nhearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy\\nthe church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which\\nGod had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon\\nthe face of the land for the righteous' sake.\\n\\nAlma 46:11\\n 11 And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief\\ncommander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these\\ndissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah.\\n\\nAlma 46:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a\\npiece thereof, and wrote upon it--In memory of our God, our\\nreligion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our\\nchildren--and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.\\n\\nAlma 46:13\\n 13 And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and\\nhis shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took\\nthe pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he\\ncalled it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the\\nearth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of\\nliberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band\\nof Christians remain to possess the land--\\n\\nAlma 46:14\\n 14 For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged\\nto the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the\\nchurch.\\n\\nAlma 46:15\\n 15 And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea,\\nall those who were true believers in Christ took upon them,\\ngladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called,\\nbecause of their belief in Christ who should come.\\n\\nAlma 46:16\\n 16 And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of\\nthe Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.\\n\\nAlma 46:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to\\nGod, he named all the land which was south of the land\\nDesolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and\\non the south--A chosen land, and the land of liberty.\\n\\nAlma 46:18\\n 18 And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are\\ndespised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be\\ntrodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own\\ntransgressions.\\n\\nAlma 46:19\\n 19 And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the\\npeople, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all\\nmight see the writing which he had written upon the rent part,\\nand crying with a loud voice, saying:\\n\\nAlma 46:20\\n 20 Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let\\nthem come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a\\ncovenant that they will maintain their rights, and their\\nreligion, that the Lord God may bless them.\\n\\nAlma 46:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these\\nwords, behold, the people came running together with their armor\\ngirded about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as\\na covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or,\\nin other words, if they should transgress the commandments of\\nGod, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them\\nthe name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had\\nrent their garments.\\n\\nAlma 46:22\\n 22 Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast\\ntheir garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with\\nour God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the\\nland northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may\\ncast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our\\ngarments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall\\ninto transgression.\\n\\nAlma 46:23\\n 23 Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed\\nof Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat\\nwas rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold,\\nlet us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments\\nshall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be\\nsold, or be slain.\\n\\nAlma 46:24\\n 24 Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea,\\nlet us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold,\\nhe saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was\\npreserved and had not decayed.  And he said--Even as this remnant\\nof garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of\\nthe seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken\\nunto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall\\nperish, even as the remnant of his garment.\\n\\nAlma 46:25\\n 25 Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul\\nhath joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall\\nbe taken unto God.\\n\\nAlma 46:26\\n 26 Now behold, this was the language of Jacob.\\n\\nAlma 46:27\\n 27 And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of\\nJoseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have\\ndissented from us?  Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do\\nnot stand fast in the faith of Christ.\\n\\nAlma 46:28\\n 28 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words\\nhe went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land\\nwhere there were dissensions, and gathered together all the\\npeople who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand\\nagainst Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called\\nAmalickiahites.\\n\\nAlma 46:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people\\nof Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites--and he also\\nsaw that his people were doubtful concerning the justice of the\\ncause in which they had undertaken--therefore, fearing that he\\nshould not gain the point, he took those of his people who would\\nand departed into the land of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 46:30\\n 30 Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites\\nshould have any more strength; therefore he thought to cut off\\nthe people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back,\\nand put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir\\nup the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to\\nbattle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do\\nthat he might obtain his purposes.\\n\\nAlma 46:31\\n 31 Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take\\nhis armies, who had gathered themselves together, and armed\\nthemselves, and entered into a covenant to keep the peace--and it\\ncame to pass that he took his army and marched out with his tents\\ninto the wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 46:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and\\nmarched forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of\\nAmalickiah.\\n\\nAlma 46:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a small number\\nof his men, and the remainder were delivered up into the hands of\\nMoroni and were taken back into the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 46:34\\n 34 Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges\\nand the voice of the people, therefore he had power according to\\nhis will with the armies of the Nephites, to establish and to\\nexercise authority over them.\\n\\nAlma 46:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites\\nthat would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of\\nfreedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to\\nbe put to death; and there were but few who denied the covenant\\nof freedom.\\n\\nAlma 46:36\\n 36 And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty\\nto be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land, which\\nwas possessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the\\nstandard of liberty among the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 46:37\\n 37 And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they\\ndid maintain peace in the land until nearly the end of the\\nnineteenth year of the reign of the judges.\\n\\nAlma 46:38\\n 38 And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in\\nthe church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have\\nmuch peace and rejoicing in the church.\\n\\nAlma 46:39\\n 39 And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly\\nbelieving that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus\\nChrist; thus they went out of the world rejoicing.\\n\\nAlma 46:40\\n 40 And there were some who died with fevers, which at some\\nseasons of the year were very frequent in the land--but not so\\nmuch so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the\\nmany plants and roots which God had prepared to remove the cause\\nof diseases, to which men were subject by the nature of the\\nclimate--\\n\\nAlma 46:41\\n 41 But there were many who died with old age; and those who died\\nin the faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs\\nsuppose.\\n\\nAlma 47\\nChapter 47\\n\\nAlma 47:1\\n 1 Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who\\nhad fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken\\nthose who went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi among\\nthe Lamanites, and did stir up the Lamanites to anger against the\\npeople of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a\\nproclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that\\nthey should gather themselves together again to go to battle\\nagainst the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 47:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth\\namong them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to\\ndisplease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against\\nthe Nephites lest they should lose their lives.  And it came to\\npass that they would not, or the more part of them would not,\\nobey the commandments of the king.\\n\\nAlma 47:3\\n 3 And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of\\ntheir disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of\\nthat part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and\\ncommanded him that he should go forth and compel them to arms.\\n\\nAlma 47:4\\n 4 Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a\\nvery subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his\\nheart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 47:5\\n 5 And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites\\nwho were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of\\nthose who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the\\nplace which was called Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites\\nfled; for they discovered the army coming, and, supposing that\\nthey were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah,\\nto the place of arms.\\n\\nAlma 47:6\\n 6 And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over\\nthem, being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution\\nthat they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 47:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together\\nupon the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in\\npreparation to battle.\\n\\nAlma 47:8\\n 8 Now it was not Amalickiah's intention to give them battle\\naccording to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his\\nintention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he\\nmight place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take\\npossession of the kingdom.\\n\\nAlma 47:9\\n 9 And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch\\ntheir tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas.\\n\\nAlma 47:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret\\nembassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those\\nwho were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should\\ncome down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with\\nhim.\\n\\nAlma 47:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he\\ndurst not go down to the foot of the mount.  And it came to pass\\nthat Amalickiah sent again the second time, desiring him to come\\ndown.  And it came to pass that Lehonti would not; and he sent\\nagain the third time.\\n\\nAlma 47:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could\\nnot get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into\\nthe mount, nearly to Lehonti's camp; and he sent again the fourth\\ntime his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down,\\nand that he would bring his guards with him.\\n\\nAlma 47:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his\\nguards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down\\nwith his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their\\ncamps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would\\ndeliver them up into Lehonti's hands, if he would make him\\n(Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army.\\n\\nAlma 47:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and\\nsurrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at\\nthe dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti.\\n\\nAlma 47:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that when they saw that they were\\nsurrounded, they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them\\nto fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed.\\n\\nNow this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired.\\n\\nAlma 47:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to\\nthe commands of the king.  Now this was the thing that Amalickiah\\ndesired, that he might accomplish his designs in dethroning the\\nking.\\n\\nAlma 47:17\\n 17 Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief\\nleader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief\\nleader.\\n\\nAlma 47:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Amalickiah caused that one of his\\nservants should administer poison by degrees to Lehonti, that he\\ndied.\\n\\nAlma 47:19\\n 19 Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed\\nAmalickiah to be their leader and their chief commander.\\n\\nAlma 47:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that Amalickiah marched with his armies\\n(for he had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city\\nof Nephi, which was the chief city.\\n\\nAlma 47:21\\n 21 And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he\\nsupposed that Amalickiah had fulfilled his commands, and that\\nAmalickiah had gathered together so great an army to go against\\nthe Nephites to battle.\\n\\nAlma 47:22\\n 22 But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah\\ncaused that his servants should go forth to meet the king.  And\\nthey went and bowed themselves before the king, as if to\\nreverence him because of his greatness.\\n\\nAlma 47:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise\\nthem, as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace,\\nwhich custom they had taken from the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 47:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that when he had raised the first from\\nthe ground, behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell\\nto the earth.\\n\\nAlma 47:25\\n 25 Now the servants of the king fled; and the servants of\\nAmalickiah raised a cry, saying:\\n\\nAlma 47:26\\n 26 Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the\\nheart, and he has fallen and they have fled; behold, come and\\nsee.\\n\\nAlma 47:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that Amalickiah commanded that his armies\\nshould march forth and see what had happened to the king; and\\nwhen they had come to the spot, and found the king lying in his\\ngore, Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, and said: Whosoever loved\\nthe king, let him go forth, and pursue his servants that they may\\nbe slain.\\n\\nAlma 47:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that all they who loved the king, when\\nthey heard these words, came forth and pursued after the servants\\nof the king.\\n\\nAlma 47:29\\n 29 Now when the servants of the king saw an army pursuing after\\nthem, they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness,\\nand came over into the land of Zarahemla and joined the people of\\nAmmon.\\n\\nAlma 47:30\\n 30 And the army which pursued after them returned, having\\npursued after them in vain; and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud,\\ngained the hearts of the people.\\n\\nAlma 47:31\\n 31 And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi\\nwith his armies, and took possession of the city.\\n\\nAlma 47:32\\n 32 And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard\\nthat the king was slain--for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to\\nthe queen informing her that the king had been slain by his\\nservants, that he had pursued them with his army, but it was in\\nvain, and they had made their escape--\\n\\nAlma 47:33\\n 33 Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent\\nunto Amalickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people of\\nthe city; and she also desired him that he should come in unto\\nher; and she also desired him that he should bring witnesses with\\nhim to testify concerning the death of the king.\\n\\nAlma 47:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant\\nthat slew the king, and all them who were with him, and went in\\nunto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all\\ntestified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants;\\nand they said also: They have fled; does not this testify against\\nthem?   And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death of\\nthe king.\\n\\nAlma 47:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the\\nqueen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and\\nby the assistance of his cunning servants, he obtained the\\nkingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land,\\namong all the people of the Lamanites, who were composed of the\\nLamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the\\ndissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the\\npresent time.\\n\\nAlma 47:36\\n 36 Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the\\nsame information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in\\nthe same knowledge of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to\\nrelate, not long after their dissensions they became more\\nhardened and impenitent, and more wild, wicked and ferocious than\\nthe Lamanites--drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites;\\ngiving way to indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea,\\nentirely forgetting the Lord their God.\\n\\nAlma 48\\nChapter 48\\n\\nAlma 48:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had\\nobtained the kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the\\nLamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to\\nspeak unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 48:2\\n 2 And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites,\\ninsomuch that in the latter end of the nineteenth year of the\\nreign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far,\\nyea, having been made king over the Lamanites, he sought also to\\nreign over all the land, yea, and all the people who were in the\\nland, the Nephites as well as the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 48:3\\n 3 Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened\\nthe hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred\\nthem up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a\\nnumerous host to go to battle against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 48:4\\n 4 For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number\\nof his people, to overpower the Nephites and to bring them into\\nbondage.\\n\\nAlma 48:5\\n 5 And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they\\nbeing the most acquainted with the strength of the Nephites, and\\ntheir places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities;\\ntherefore he appointed them to be chief captains over his armies.\\n\\nAlma 48:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth\\ntoward the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 48:7\\n 7 Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been\\nobtaining power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other hand,\\nhad been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto\\nthe Lord their God.\\n\\nAlma 48:8\\n 8 Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and\\nerecting small forts, or places of resort; throwing up banks of\\nearth round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls\\nof stone to encircle them about, round about their cities and the\\nborders of their lands; yea, all round about the land.\\n\\nAlma 48:9\\n 9 And in their weakest fortifications he did place the greater\\nnumber of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land\\nwhich was possessed by the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 48:10\\n 10 And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their\\nlands, their wives, and their children, and their peace, and that\\nthey might live unto the Lord their God, and that they might\\nmaintain that which was called by their enemies the cause of\\nChristians.\\n\\nAlma 48:11\\n 11 And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a\\nperfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in\\nbloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the\\nfreedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage and\\nslavery;\\n\\nAlma 48:12\\n 12 Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his\\nGod, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon\\nhis people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and\\nsafety of his people.\\n\\nAlma 48:13\\n 13 Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ,\\nand he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights,\\nand his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.\\n\\nAlma 48:14\\n 14 Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against\\ntheir enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were\\nnecessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an\\noffense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against\\nan enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.\\n\\nAlma 48:15\\n 15 And this was their faith, that by so doing God would prosper\\nthem in the land, or in other words, if they were faithful in\\nkeeping the commandments of God that he would prosper them in the\\nland; yea, warn them to flee, or to prepare for war, according to\\ntheir danger;\\n\\nAlma 48:16\\n 16 And also, that God would make it known unto them whither they\\nshould go to defend themselves against their enemies, and by so\\ndoing, the Lord would deliver them; and this was the faith of\\nMoroni, and his heart did glory in it; not in the shedding of\\nblood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in\\nkeeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.\\n\\nAlma 48:17\\n 17 Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and\\nwere, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very\\npowers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil\\nwould never have power over the hearts of the children of men.\\n\\nAlma 48:18\\n 18 Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea,\\nand even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his\\nsons, for they were all men of God.\\n\\nAlma 48:19\\n 19 Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable\\nunto the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of\\nGod, and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would\\nhearken unto their words.\\n\\nAlma 48:20\\n 20 And thus they went forth, and the people did humble\\nthemselves because of their words, insomuch that they were highly\\nfavored of the Lord, and thus they were free from wars and\\ncontentions among themselves, yea, even for the space of four\\nyears.\\n\\nAlma 48:21\\n 21 But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth\\nyear, yea, notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they\\nwere compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the\\nLamanites.\\n\\nAlma 48:22\\n 22 Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of\\nmany years with the Lamanites, notwithstanding their much\\nreluctance.\\n\\nAlma 48:23\\n 23 Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites,\\nbecause they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and\\nthis was not all--they were sorry to be the means of sending so\\nmany of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world,\\nunprepared to meet their God.\\n\\nAlma 48:24\\n 24 Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives,\\nthat their wives and their children should be massacred by the\\nbarbarous cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and\\nhad dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone\\nto destroy them by joining the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 48:25\\n 25 Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice\\nover the blood of the Nephites, so long as there were any who\\nshould keep the commandments of God, for the promise of the Lord\\nwas, if they should keep his commandments they should prosper in\\nthe land.\\n\\nAlma 49\\nChapter 49\\n\\nAlma 49:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass in the eleventh month of the\\nnineteenth year, on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the\\nLamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.\\n\\nAlma 49:2\\n 2 And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had\\nstationed an army by the borders of the city, and they had cast\\nup dirt around about to shield them from the arrows and the\\nstones of the Lamanites; for behold, they fought with stones and\\nwith arrows.\\n\\nAlma 49:3\\n 3 Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt.  I\\nsay unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the\\nLamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the\\npeople, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 49:4\\n 4 But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold,\\nthe Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round about them, which\\nwas so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and\\ntheir arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could\\nthey come upon them save it was by their place of entrance.\\n\\nAlma 49:5\\n 5 Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were\\nastonished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in\\npreparing their places of security.\\n\\nAlma 49:6\\n 6 Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the\\ngreatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should\\nbe privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea,\\nand they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with\\nbreastplates; and they had also prepared themselves with garments\\nof skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness.\\n\\nAlma 49:7\\n 7 And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily\\noverpower and subject their brethren to the yoke of bondage, or\\nslay and massacre them according to their pleasure.\\n\\nAlma 49:8\\n 8 But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were\\nprepared for them, in a manner which never had been known among\\nthe children of Lehi.  Now they were prepared for the Lamanites,\\nto battle after the manner of the instructions of Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 49:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites,\\nwere exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for\\nwar.\\n\\nAlma 49:10\\n 10 Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of\\nNephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he would have caused the\\nLamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah;\\nfor behold, he did care not for the blood of his people.\\n\\nAlma 49:11\\n 11 But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle. \\nAnd behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at\\nthe city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of\\naffairs among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were\\ndisappointed in their places of retreat and they could not come\\nupon them.\\n\\nAlma 49:12\\n 12 Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their\\ncamp and marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be\\nthe next best place for them to come against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 49:13\\n 13 For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built\\nforts of security, for every city in all the land round about;\\ntherefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm\\ndetermination; yea, their chief captains came forward and took an\\noath that they would destroy the people of that city.\\n\\nAlma 49:14\\n 14 But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which\\nhad hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni,\\nbecome strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city\\nAmmonihah.\\n\\nAlma 49:15\\n 15 And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had\\nsupposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and\\nas the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the\\nland, therefore they would march thither to battle; and thus it\\nwas according to his desires.\\n\\nAlma 49:16\\n 16 And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain\\nover the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought\\nwith the Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon.\\n\\nAlma 49:17\\n 17 And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had\\nfound that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed,\\nfor they feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless their chief\\ncaptains had sworn with an oath to attack the city; therefore,\\nthey brought up their armies.\\n\\nAlma 49:18\\n 18 Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of\\nsecurity by any other way save by the entrance, because of the\\nhighness of the bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of\\nthe ditch which had been dug round about, save it were by the\\nentrance.\\n\\nAlma 49:19\\n 19 And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as\\nshould attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by\\ncasting over stones and arrows at them.\\n\\nAlma 49:20\\n 20 Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men,\\nwith their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should\\nattempt to come into their place of security by the place of\\nentrance; and thus were they prepared to defend themselves\\nagainst the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 49:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites\\nbrought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began\\nto contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of\\nsecurity; but behold, they were driven back from time to time,\\ninsomuch that they were slain with an immense slaughter.\\n\\nAlma 49:22\\n 22 Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the\\nNephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth\\nthat they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might\\nhave an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they\\nwere swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at\\nthem; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the\\nbanks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their dead\\nand wounded bodies.\\n\\nAlma 49:23\\n 23 Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus\\nthe Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their\\nchief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of\\nthe Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not\\na single soul of the Nephites which was slain.\\n\\nAlma 49:24\\n 24 There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed\\nto the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were\\nshielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their\\nhead-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs,\\nmany of which were very severe.\\n\\nAlma 49:25\\n 25 And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their\\nchief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness.  And\\nit came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to\\ninform their king, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth,\\nconcerning their great loss.\\n\\nAlma 49:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his\\npeople, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites;\\nhe had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage.\\n\\nAlma 49:27\\n 27 Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also\\nMoroni, swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and\\nthis because Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing\\nfor the safety of his people.\\n\\nAlma 49:28\\n 28 And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of\\nNephi did thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless\\npower in delivering them from the hands of their enemies.\\n\\nAlma 49:29\\n 29 And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges\\nover the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 49:30\\n 30 Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and\\nexceedingly great prosperity in the church because of their heed\\nand diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was\\ndeclared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and\\nAmmon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been\\nordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto\\nrepentance, and sent forth to preach among the people.\\n\\nAlma 50\\nChapter 50\\n\\nAlma 50:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making\\npreparations for war, or to defend his people against the\\nLamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the\\ncommencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges,\\nthat they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round\\nabout all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed\\nby the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 50:2\\n 2 And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there\\nshould be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height\\nof a man, round about the cities.\\n\\nAlma 50:3\\n 3 And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be\\na frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they\\nwere strong and high.\\n\\nAlma 50:4\\n 4 And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works\\nof pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon\\nthose towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites\\ncould not hurt them.\\n\\nAlma 50:5\\n 5 And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the\\ntop thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and\\nslay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the\\ncity.\\n\\nAlma 50:6\\n 6 Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of\\ntheir enemies, round about every city in all the land.\\n\\nAlma 50:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should\\ngo forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and\\ndrove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into\\ntheir own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 50:8\\n 8 And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the\\neast sea to the west.\\n\\nAlma 50:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the\\nLamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the\\nlands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants\\nwho were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about\\nshould go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by\\nthe seashore, and possess the land.\\n\\nAlma 50:10\\n 10 And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of\\ntheir possessions, and caused them to erect fortifications that\\nthey might secure their armies and their people from the hands of\\ntheir enemies.\\n\\nAlma 50:11\\n 11 And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in\\nthe east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the\\nline between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of\\nZarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by\\nthe head of the river Sidon--the Nephites possessing all the land\\nnorthward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land\\nBountiful, according to their pleasure.\\n\\nAlma 50:12\\n 12 Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily\\nbecause of the assurance of protection which his works did bring\\nforth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power\\nof the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that\\nthey should have no power upon the lands of their possession.\\n\\nAlma 50:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of\\na city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was\\nby the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the\\npossessions of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 50:14\\n 14 And they also began a foundation for a city between the city\\nof Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and\\nMoroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land,\\nNephihah.\\n\\nAlma 50:15\\n 15 And they also began in that same year to build many cities on\\nthe north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi,\\nwhich was in the north by the borders of the seashore.\\n\\nAlma 50:16\\n 16 And thus ended the twentieth year.\\n\\nAlma 50:17\\n 17 And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of\\nNephi in the commencement of the twenty and first year of the\\nreign of the judges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 50:18\\n 18 And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly\\nrich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.\\n\\nAlma 50:19\\n 19 And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of\\nthe Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of\\nmen; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this\\ntime, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:\\n\\nAlma 50:20\\n 20 Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed,\\ninasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in\\nthe land.   But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my\\ncommandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.\\n\\nAlma 50:21\\n 21 And we see that these promises have been verified to the\\npeople of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their\\ncontentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their\\nidolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were\\namong themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their\\ndestructions.\\n\\nAlma 50:22\\n 22 And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of\\nthe Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their\\nwicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by\\nthe sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the\\nLamanites.\\n\\nAlma 50:23\\n 23 But behold there never was a happier time among the people of\\nNephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea,\\neven at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of\\nthe judges.\\n\\nAlma 50:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the\\nreign of the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty\\nand third year.\\n\\nAlma 50:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty\\nand fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have\\nbeen peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a\\ncontention which took place among them concerning the land of\\nLehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of\\nLehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.\\n\\nAlma 50:26\\n 26 For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton\\ndid claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be\\na warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of\\nMorianton took up arms against their brethren, and they were\\ndetermined by the sword to slay them.\\n\\nAlma 50:27\\n 27 But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to\\nthe camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for\\nbehold they were not in the wrong.\\n\\nAlma 50:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who\\nwere led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people\\nof Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly\\nfearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 50:29\\n 29 Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they\\nshould flee to the land which was northward, which was covered\\nwith large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which\\nwas northward.\\n\\nAlma 50:30\\n 30 And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect,\\n(which would have been a cause to have been lamented) but behold,\\nMorianton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry\\nwith one of his maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her\\nmuch.\\n\\nAlma 50:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp\\nof Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and\\nalso concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward.\\n\\nAlma 50:32\\n 32 Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or\\nrather Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of\\nMorianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain\\npossession of those parts of the land, which would lay a\\nfoundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi,\\nyea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their\\nliberty.\\n\\nAlma 50:33\\n 33 Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the\\npeople of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land\\nnorthward.\\n\\nAlma 50:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that they did not head them until they\\nhad come to the borders of the land Desolation; and there they\\ndid head them, by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the\\nland northward, yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east.\\n\\nAlma 50:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni,\\nwhich was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the\\npeople of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of\\nMorianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering\\nwords) that a battle commenced between them, in the which Teancum\\ndid slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners,\\nand returned to the camp of Moroni.  And thus ended the twenty\\nand fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of\\nNephi.\\n\\nAlma 50:36\\n 36 And thus were the people of Morianton brought back.  And upon\\ntheir covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the\\nland of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the\\npeople of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands.\\n\\nAlma 50:37\\n 37 And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of\\nNephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second\\nchief judge, died, having filled the judgment-seat with perfect\\nuprightness before God.\\n\\nAlma 50:38\\n 38 Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those\\nrecords and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his\\nfathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon\\nhis son, Helaman.\\n\\nAlma 50:39\\n 39 Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was\\nappointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father;\\nyea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people,\\nwith an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to\\nkeep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto\\nthem their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea,\\nto support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to\\nbring the wicked to justice according to their crime.\\n\\nAlma 50:40\\n 40 Now behold, his name was Pahoran.  And Pahoran did fill the\\nseat of his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the\\ntwenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 51\\nChapter 51\\n\\nAlma 51:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and\\nfifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi,\\nthey having established peace between the people of Lehi and the\\npeople of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced\\nthe twenty and fifth year in peace;\\n\\nAlma 51:2\\n 2 Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in\\nthe land, for there began to be a contention among the people\\nconcerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part\\nof the people who desired that a few particular points of the law\\nshould be altered.\\n\\nAlma 51:3\\n 3 But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be\\naltered; therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in\\ntheir voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the\\nlaw.\\n\\nAlma 51:4\\n 4 Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be\\naltered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer\\nbe chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm\\ndispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.\\n\\nAlma 51:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran\\nshould be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men,\\nfor they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner\\nto overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the\\nland.\\n\\nAlma 51:6\\n 6 And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief\\njudge over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus\\nwas the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or\\ncovenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their\\nreligion by a free government.\\n\\nAlma 51:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was\\nsettled by the voice of the people.  And it came to pass that the\\nvoice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran\\nretained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the\\nbrethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who\\nalso put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but\\nwere obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.\\n\\nAlma 51:8\\n 8 Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth,\\nand they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who\\nsought power and authority over the people.\\n\\nAlma 51:9\\n 9 But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to\\nbe among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again\\nstirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the\\npeople of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers\\nfrom all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for\\nwar with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of\\nMoroni.\\n\\nAlma 51:10\\n 10 But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was\\nrash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come\\nto battle against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 51:11\\n 11 Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been,\\nbecause of the many thousands who had been slain by the hand of\\nthe Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah\\nhad gathered together a wonderfully great army, insomuch that he\\nfeared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 51:12\\n 12 Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of\\nthe Lamanites.  And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the\\nreign of the judges; and it was at the same time that they had\\nbegun to settle the affairs of their contentions concerning the\\nchief judge, Pahoran.\\n\\nAlma 51:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that when the men who were called\\nking-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle\\nagainst them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to\\ntake up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and\\nalso with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms\\nto defend their country.\\n\\nAlma 51:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw\\nthat the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he\\nwas exceedingly wroth because of the stubbornness of those people\\nwhom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he\\nwas exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 51:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice\\nof the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he\\nshould read it, and give him (Moroni) power to compel those\\ndissenters to defend their country or to put them to death.\\n\\nAlma 51:16\\n 16 For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions\\nand dissensions among the people; for behold, this had been\\nhitherto a cause of all their destruction.  And it came to pass\\nthat it was granted according to the voice of the people.\\n\\nAlma 51:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army\\nshould go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and\\ntheir nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take\\nup arms and support the cause of liberty.\\n\\nAlma 51:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against\\nthem; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility,\\ninsomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight\\nagainst the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the\\nearth.\\n\\nAlma 51:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those\\ndissenters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their\\nleaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast into\\nprison, for there was no time for their trials at this period.\\n\\nAlma 51:20\\n 20 And the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten\\ndown to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of\\nliberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty upon\\ntheir towers, and in their cities, and to take up arms in defence\\nof their country.\\n\\nAlma 51:21\\n 21 And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were\\nnot any known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an\\nend to the stubbornness and the pride of those people who\\nprofessed the blood of nobility; but they were brought down to\\nhumble themselves like unto their brethren, and to fight\\nvaliantly for their freedom from bondage.\\n\\nAlma 51:22\\n 22 Behold, it came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking\\ndown the wars and contentions among his own people, and\\nsubjecting them to peace and civilization, and making regulations\\nto prepare for war against the Lamanites, behold, the Lamanites\\nhad come into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the\\nseashore.\\n\\nAlma 51:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently\\nstrong in the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive\\nthem, slaying many.  And it came to pass that Amalickiah took\\npossession of the city, yea, possession of all their\\nfortifications.\\n\\nAlma 51:24\\n 24 And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city\\nof Nephihah; and also the people of the city of Lehi gathered\\nthemselves together, and made preparations and were ready to\\nreceive the Lamanites to battle.\\n\\nAlma 51:25\\n 25 But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the\\nLamanites to go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept\\nthem down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain\\nand defend it.\\n\\nAlma 51:26\\n 26 And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the\\ncity of Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of\\nMorianton, and the city of Omner, and the city of Gid, and the\\ncity of Mulek, all of which were on the east borders by the\\nseashore.\\n\\nAlma 51:27\\n 27 And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of\\nAmalickiah, so many cities, by their numberless hosts, all of\\nwhich were strongly fortified after the manner of the\\nfortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded strongholds for\\nthe Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 51:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that they marched to the borders of the\\nland Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying\\nmany.\\n\\nAlma 51:29\\n 29 But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had\\nslain Morianton and had headed his people in his flight.\\n\\nAlma 51:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was\\nmarching forth with his numerous army that he might take\\npossession of the land Bountiful, and also the land northward.\\n\\nAlma 51:31\\n 31 But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by\\nTeancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man\\nof Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in\\ntheir skill of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over\\nthe Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 51:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that\\nthey did slay them even until it was dark.  And it came to pass\\nthat Teancum and his men did pitch their tents in the borders of\\nthe land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the\\nborders on the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were\\nthey driven.\\n\\nAlma 51:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and\\nhis servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the\\ncamp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them\\nbecause of their much fatigue, which was caused by the labors and\\nheat of the day.\\n\\nAlma 51:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent\\nof the king, and put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the\\ndeath of the king immediately that he did not awake his servants.\\n\\nAlma 51:35\\n 35 And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold,\\nhis men were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the\\nthings that he had done.\\n\\nAlma 51:36\\n 36 And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest\\nthe Lamanites had awakened and should come upon them.\\n\\nAlma 51:37\\n 37 And thus endeth the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi; and thus endeth the days of\\nAmalickiah.\\n\\nAlma 52\\nChapter 52\\n\\nAlma 52:1\\n 1 And now, it came to pass in the twenty and sixth year of the\\nreign of the judges over the people of Nephi, behold, when the\\nLamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month, behold,\\nthey found Amalickiah was dead in his own tent; and they also saw\\nthat Teancum was ready to give them battle on that day.\\n\\nAlma 52:2\\n 2 And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and\\nthey abandoned their design in marching into the land northward,\\nand retreated with all their army into the city of Mulek, and\\nsought protection in their fortifications.\\n\\nAlma 52:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was\\nappointed king over the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus\\nking Ammoron, the brother of king Amalickiah, was appointed to\\nreign in his stead.\\n\\nAlma 52:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that he did command that his people should\\nmaintain those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of\\nblood; for they had not taken any cities save they had lost much\\nblood.\\n\\nAlma 52:5\\n 5 And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to\\nmaintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of\\nthe land which they had obtained possession of; and also seeing\\nthe enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was not\\nexpedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts.\\n\\nAlma 52:6\\n 6 But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for\\nwar; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against\\nthem, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of\\nresort.\\n\\nAlma 52:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that he kept thus preparing for war until\\nMoroni had sent a large number of men to strengthen his army.\\n\\nAlma 52:8\\n 8 And Moroni also sent orders unto him that he should retain all\\nthe prisoners who fell into his hands; for as the Lamanites had\\ntaken many prisoners, that he should retain all the prisoners of\\nthe Lamanites as a ransom for those whom the Lamanites had taken.\\n\\nAlma 52:9\\n 9 And he also sent orders unto him that he should fortify the\\nland Bountiful, and secure the narrow pass which led into the\\nland northward, lest the Lamanites should obtain that point and\\nshould have power to harass them on every side.\\n\\nAlma 52:10\\n 10 And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be\\nfaithful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he\\nwould seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that\\nquarter, as much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take\\nagain by stratagem or some other way those cities which had been\\ntaken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and\\nstrengthen the cities round about, which had not fallen into the\\nhands of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 52:11\\n 11 And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold,\\nthe Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the west\\nsea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto\\nyou.\\n\\nAlma 52:12\\n 12 Now, the king (Ammoron) had departed out of the land of\\nZarahemla, and had made known unto the queen concerning the death\\nof his brother, and had gathered together a large number of men,\\nand had marched forth against the Nephites on the borders by the\\nwest sea.\\n\\nAlma 52:13\\n 13 And thus he was endeavoring to harass the Nephites, and to\\ndraw away a part of their forces to that part of the land, while\\nhe had commanded those whom he had left to possess the cities\\nwhich he had taken, that they should also harass the Nephites on\\nthe borders by the east sea, and should take possession of their\\nlands as much as it was in their power, according to the power of\\ntheir armies.\\n\\nAlma 52:14\\n 14 And thus were the Nephites in those dangerous circumstances\\nin the ending of the twenty and sixth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 52:15\\n 15 But behold, it came to pass in the twenty and seventh year of\\nthe reign of the judges, that Teancum, by the command of\\nMoroni--who had established armies to protect the south and the\\nwest borders of the land, and had begun his march towards the\\nland Bountiful, that he might assist Teancum with his men in\\nretaking the cities which they had lost--\\n\\nAlma 52:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that Teancum had received orders to make\\nan attack upon the city of Mulek, and retake it if it were\\npossible.\\n\\nAlma 52:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an\\nattack upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army\\nagainst the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he\\ncould overpower them while they were in their fortifications;\\ntherefore he abandoned his designs and returned again to the city\\nBountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might\\nreceive strength to his army.\\n\\nAlma 52:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Moroni did arrive with his army at\\nthe land of Bountiful, in the latter end of the twenty and\\nseventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 52:19\\n 19 And in the commencement of the twenty and eighth year, Moroni\\nand Teancum and many of the chief captains held a council of\\nwar--what they should do to cause the Lamanites to come out\\nagainst them to battle; or that they might by some means flatter\\nthem out of their strongholds, that they might gain advantage\\nover them and take again the city of Mulek.\\n\\nAlma 52:20\\n 20 And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the\\nLamanites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader,\\nwhose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with\\nhis armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities. \\nBut behold, Jacob, who was a Zoramite, would not come out with\\nhis army to meet them upon the plains.\\n\\nAlma 52:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that Moroni, having no hopes of meeting\\nthem upon fair grounds, therefore, he resolved upon a plan that\\nhe might decoy the Lamanites out of their strongholds.\\n\\nAlma 52:22\\n 22 Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number\\nof men and march down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army,\\nby night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city\\nMulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites\\nhad discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their\\nleader.\\n\\nAlma 52:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did\\nmarch forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to\\noverpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers.  And\\nas Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him\\nhe began to retreat down by the seashore, northward.\\n\\nAlma 52:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that he began\\nto flee, they took courage and pursued them with vigor.  And\\nwhile Teancum was thus leading away the Lamanites who were\\npursuing them in vain, behold, Moroni commanded that a part of\\nhis army who were with him should march forth into the city, and\\ntake possession of it.\\n\\nAlma 52:25\\n 25 And thus they did, and slew all those who had been left to\\nprotect the city, yea, all those who would not yield up their\\nweapons of war.\\n\\nAlma 52:26\\n 26 And thus Moroni had obtained possession of the city Mulek\\nwith a part of his army, while he marched with the remainder to\\nmeet the Lamanites when they should return from the pursuit of\\nTeancum.\\n\\nAlma 52:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue Teancum\\nuntil they came near the city Bountiful, and then they were met\\nby Lehi and a small army, which had been left to protect the city\\nBountiful.\\n\\nAlma 52:28\\n 28 And now behold, when the chief captains of the Lamanites had\\nbeheld Lehi with his army coming against them, they fled in much\\nconfusion, lest perhaps they should not obtain the city Mulek\\nbefore Lehi should overtake them; for they were wearied because\\nof their march, and the men of Lehi were fresh.\\n\\nAlma 52:29\\n 29 Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their\\nrear with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.\\n\\nAlma 52:30\\n 30 Now Lehi was not desirous to overtake them till they should\\nmeet Moroni and his army.\\n\\nAlma 52:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that before the Lamanites had retreated\\nfar they were surrounded by the Nephites, by the men of Moroni on\\none hand, and the men of Lehi on the other, all of whom were\\nfresh and full of strength; but the Lamanites were wearied\\nbecause of their long march.\\n\\nAlma 52:32\\n 32 And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them\\nuntil they had given up their weapons of war.\\n\\nAlma 52:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being\\nalso a Zoramite, and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the\\nLamanites forth to battle with exceeding fury against Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 52:34\\n 34 Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was\\ndetermined to slay them and cut his way through to the city of\\nMulek.  But behold, Moroni and his men were more powerful;\\ntherefore they did not give way before the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 52:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with\\nexceeding fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and\\nMoroni was wounded and Jacob was killed.\\n\\nAlma 52:36\\n 36 And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his\\nstrong men, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their\\nweapons of war; and the remainder of them, being much confused,\\nknew not whither to go or to strike.\\n\\nAlma 52:37\\n 37 Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye\\nwill bring forth your weapons of war and deliver them up, behold\\nwe will forbear shedding your blood.\\n\\nAlma 52:38\\n 38 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had heard these\\nwords, their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came\\nforth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni,\\nand also commanded their men that they should do the same.\\n\\nAlma 52:39\\n 39 But behold, there were many that would not; and those who\\nwould not deliver up their swords were taken and bound, and their\\nweapons of war were taken from them, and they were compelled to\\nmarch with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful.\\n\\nAlma 52:40\\n 40 And now the number of prisoners who were taken exceeded more\\nthan the number of those who had been slain, yea, more than those\\nwho had been slain on both sides.\\n\\nAlma 53\\nChapter 53\\n\\nAlma 53:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that they did set guards over the\\nprisoners of the Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and\\nbury their dead, yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were\\nslain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they\\nshould perform their labors.\\n\\nAlma 53:2\\n 2 And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took\\ncommand of the city and gave it unto Lehi.  Now behold, this Lehi\\nwas a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his\\nbattles; and he was a man like unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in\\neach other's safety; yea, they were beloved by each other, and\\nalso beloved by all the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 53:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished\\nburying their dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were\\nmarched back into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders\\nof Moroni, caused that they should commence laboring in digging a\\nditch round about the land, or the city, Bountiful.\\n\\nAlma 53:4\\n 4 And he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers\\nupon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of\\nthe ditch against the breastwork of timbers; and thus they did\\ncause the Lamanites to labor until they had encircled the city of\\nBountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to\\nan exceeding height.\\n\\nAlma 53:5\\n 5 And this city became an exceeding stronghold ever after; and\\nin this city they did guard the prisoners of the Lamanites; yea,\\neven within a wall which they had caused them to build with their\\nown hands.  Now Moroni was compelled to cause the Lamanites to\\nlabor, because it was easy to guard them while at their labor;\\nand he desired all his forces when he should make an attack upon\\nthe Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 53:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over\\none of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had\\nobtained possession of the city of Mulek, which was one of the\\nstrongest holds of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus\\nhe had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners.\\n\\nAlma 53:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with\\nthe Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in\\npreparing for war, yea, and in making fortifications to guard\\nagainst the Lamanites, yea, and also delivering their women and\\ntheir children from famine and affliction, and providing food for\\ntheir armies.\\n\\nAlma 53:8\\n 8 And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on\\nthe west sea, south, while in the absence of Moroni on account of\\nsome intrigue amongst the Nephites, which caused dissensions\\namongst them, had gained some ground over the Nephites, yea,\\ninsomuch that they had obtained possession of a number of their\\ncities in that part of the land.\\n\\nAlma 53:9\\n 9 And thus because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because\\nof dissensions and intrigue among themselves they were placed in\\nthe most dangerous circumstances.\\n\\nAlma 53:10\\n 10 And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people\\nof Ammon, who in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and\\nhis brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had\\nbeen converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into\\nthe land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the\\nNephites.\\n\\nAlma 53:11\\n 11 And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up\\narms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they\\nnever would shed blood more; and according to their oath they\\nwould have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to\\nhave fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for\\nthe pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had\\nhad for them.\\n\\nAlma 53:12\\n 12 And for this cause they were brought down into the land of\\nZarahemla; and they ever had been protected by the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 53:13\\n 13 But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the\\nmany afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for\\nthem, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take\\nup arms in the defence of their country.\\n\\nAlma 53:14\\n 14 But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war,\\nthey were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his\\nbrethren, for they were about to break the oath which they had\\nmade.\\n\\nAlma 53:15\\n 15 And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their\\nsouls; therefore all those who had entered into this covenant\\nwere compelled to behold their brethren wade through their\\nafflictions, in their dangerous circumstances at this time.\\n\\nAlma 53:16\\n 16 But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not\\nentered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of\\nwar to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they\\ndid assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were\\nable to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 53:17\\n 17 And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of\\nthe Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of\\ntheir lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give\\nup their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect\\nthe Nephites and themselves from bondage.\\n\\nAlma 53:18\\n 18 Now behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who\\nentered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to\\ndefend their country.\\n\\nAlma 53:19\\n 19 And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a\\ndisadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of\\ntime also a great support; for they took their weapons of war,\\nand they would that Helaman should be their leader.\\n\\nAlma 53:20\\n 20 And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly\\nvaliant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but\\nbehold, this was not all--they were men who were true at all\\ntimes in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.\\n\\nAlma 53:21\\n 21 Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been\\ntaught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly\\nbefore him.\\n\\nAlma 53:22\\n 22 And now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of\\nhis two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people\\nin the borders of the land on the south by the west sea.\\n\\nAlma 53:23\\n 23 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 54\\nChapter 54\\n\\nAlma 54:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the twenty and\\nninth year of the judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni desiring\\nthat he would exchange prisoners.\\n\\nAlma 54:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that Moroni felt to rejoice exceedingly at\\nthis request, for he desired the provisions which were imparted\\nfor the support of the Lamanite prisoners for the support of his\\nown people; and he also desired his own people for the\\nstrengthening of his army.\\n\\nAlma 54:3\\n 3 Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and there\\nwas not a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of Moroni, or\\nthe prisoners whom Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved\\nupon a stratagem to obtain as many prisoners of the Nephites from\\nthe Lamanites as it were possible.\\n\\nAlma 54:4\\n 4 Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of\\nAmmoron, the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni.  Now\\nthese are the words which he wrote unto Ammoron, saying:\\n\\nAlma 54:5\\n 5 Behold, Ammoron, I have written unto you somewhat concerning\\nthis war which ye have waged against my people, or rather which\\nthy brother hath waged against them, and which ye are still\\ndetermined to carry on after his death.\\n\\nAlma 54:6\\n 6 Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of\\nGod, and the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over\\nyou except ye repent and withdraw your armies into your own\\nlands, or the land of your possessions, which is the land of\\nNephi.\\n\\nAlma 54:7\\n 7 Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of\\nhearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful\\nhell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy\\nbrother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous\\npurposes, and return with your armies to your own lands.\\n\\nAlma 54:8\\n 8 But as ye have once rejected these things, and have fought\\nagainst the people of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do\\nit again.\\n\\nAlma 54:9\\n 9 And now behold, we are prepared to receive you; yea, and\\nexcept you withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the\\nwrath of that God whom you have rejected upon you, even to your\\nutter destruction.\\n\\nAlma 54:10\\n 10 But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you\\nexcept ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with death, for\\nwe will retain our cities and our lands; yea, and we will\\nmaintain our religion and the cause of our God.\\n\\nAlma 54:11\\n 11 But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning\\nthese things in vain; or it supposeth me that thou art a child of\\nhell; therefore I will close my epistle by telling you that I\\nwill not exchange prisoners, save it be on conditions that ye\\nwill deliver up a man and his wife and his children, for one\\nprisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I will\\nexchange.\\n\\nAlma 54:12\\n 12 And behold, if you do not this, I will come against you with\\nmy armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I\\nwill come against you, and I will follow you even into your own\\nland, which is the land of our first inheritance; yea, and it\\nshall be blood for blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you\\nbattle even until you are destroyed from off the face of the\\nearth.\\n\\nAlma 54:13\\n 13 Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought\\nto murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves.  But\\nbehold, if ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to destroy\\nyou; yea, and we will seek our land, the land of our first\\ninheritance.\\n\\nAlma 54:14\\n 14 Now I close my epistle.  I am Moroni; I am a leader of the\\npeople of the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 54:15\\n 15 Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this\\nepistle, was angry; and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni, and\\nthese are the words which he wrote, saying:\\n\\nAlma 54:16\\n 16 I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of\\nAmalickiah whom ye have murdered.  Behold, I will avenge his\\nblood upon you, yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for\\nI fear not your threatenings.\\n\\nAlma 54:17\\n 17 For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch\\nthat they did rob them of their right to the government when it\\nrightly belonged unto them.\\n\\nAlma 54:18\\n 18 And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject\\nyourselves to be governed by those to whom the government doth\\nrightly belong, then will I cause that my people shall lay down\\ntheir weapons and shall be at war no more.\\n\\nAlma 54:19\\n 19 Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and\\nmy people; but behold, we fear not your threatenings.\\n\\nAlma 54:20\\n 20 Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to\\nyour request, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of\\nwar; and we will wage a war which shall be eternal, either to the\\nsubjecting the Nephites to our authority or to their eternal\\nextinction.\\n\\nAlma 54:21\\n 21 And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected,\\nbehold, we know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be\\nthat there is such a thing, we know not but that he hath made us\\nas well as you.\\n\\nAlma 54:22\\n 22 And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will\\nhe not send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have\\nmurdered, whom ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? \\nBut behold these things matter not.\\n\\nAlma 54:23\\n 23 I am Ammoron, and a descendant of Zoram, whom your fathers\\npressed and brought out of Jerusalem.\\n\\nAlma 54:24\\n 24 And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath\\nbeen waged to avenge their wrongs, and to maintain and to obtain\\ntheir rights to the government; and I close my epistle to Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 55\\nChapter 55\\n\\nAlma 55:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle\\nhe was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect\\nknowledge of his fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it\\nwas not a just cause that had caused him to wage a war against\\nthe people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 55:2\\n 2 And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with\\nAmmoron save he will withdraw his purpose, as I have stated in my\\nepistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any\\nmore power than what he hath got.\\n\\nAlma 55:3\\n 3 Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my\\npeople whom they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not\\ngrant unto me mine epistle, behold, I will give unto him\\naccording to my words; yea, I will seek death among them until\\nthey shall sue for peace.\\n\\nAlma 55:4\\n 4 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words,\\nhe caused that a search should be made among his men, that\\nperhaps he might find a man who was a descendant of Laman among\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 55:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman;\\nand he was one of the servants of the king who was murdered by\\nAmalickiah.\\n\\nAlma 55:6\\n 6 Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men\\nshould go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 55:7\\n 7 Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore\\nMoroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men\\nshould go with him.\\n\\nAlma 55:8\\n 8 And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over\\nthe Nephites, and behold, they saw him coming and they hailed\\nhim; but he saith unto them: Fear not; behold, I am a Lamanite. \\nBehold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and\\nbehold we have taken of their wine and brought with us.\\n\\nAlma 55:9\\n 9 Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him\\nwith joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we\\nmay drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for\\nwe are weary.\\n\\nAlma 55:10\\n 10 But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go\\nagainst the Nephites to battle.  But this saying only made them\\nmore desirous to drink of the wine;\\n\\nAlma 55:11\\n 11 For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the\\nwine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which\\nwill strengthen us to go against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 55:12\\n 12 And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your\\ndesires.\\n\\nAlma 55:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely;\\nand it was pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it\\nmore freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its\\nstrength.\\n\\nAlma 55:14\\n 14 And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and\\nby they were all drunken.\\n\\nAlma 55:15\\n 15 And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all\\ndrunken, and were in a deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and\\ntold him all the things that had happened.\\n\\nAlma 55:16\\n 16 And now this was according to the design of Moroni.  And\\nMoroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to\\nthe city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and\\ndrunken, and cast in weapons of war unto the prisoners, insomuch\\nthat they were all armed;\\n\\nAlma 55:17\\n 17 Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as\\nmany as were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed\\nall those prisoners; and all those things were done in a profound\\nsilence.\\n\\nAlma 55:18\\n 18 But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken\\nand the Nephites could have slain them.\\n\\nAlma 55:19\\n 19 But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not\\ndelight in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of\\nhis people from destruction; and for this cause he might not\\nbring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites\\nand destroy them in their drunkenness.\\n\\nAlma 55:20\\n 20 But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those\\nprisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city,\\nand had given them power to gain possession of those parts which\\nwere within the walls.\\n\\nAlma 55:21\\n 21 And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a\\npace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 55:22\\n 22 Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the\\nLamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were\\nsurrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were\\narmed within.\\n\\nAlma 55:23\\n 23 And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and\\nin these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that\\nthey should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief\\ncaptains demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them\\nforth and cast them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for\\nmercy.\\n\\nAlma 55:24\\n 24 Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni.  He took them\\nprisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused\\nthat all the prisoners should be liberated, who were Nephites;\\nand they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength\\nto his army.\\n\\nAlma 55:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he\\nhad taken prisoners, that they should commence a labor in\\nstrengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid.\\n\\nAlma 55:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid,\\naccording to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be\\ntaken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with\\nan exceedingly strong force.\\n\\nAlma 55:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the\\nintrigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners\\nwhom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the\\nadvantage which they had retaken.\\n\\nAlma 55:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be\\nvictorious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.\\n\\nAlma 55:29\\n 29 Many time did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by\\nnight, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.\\n\\nAlma 55:30\\n 30 And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine\\nto the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with\\ndrunkenness.\\n\\nAlma 55:31\\n 31 But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord\\ntheir God in this their time of affliction.  They could not be\\ntaken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine,\\nsave they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.\\n\\nAlma 55:32\\n 32 And they were thus cautious that no poison should be\\nadministered among them; for if their wine would poison a\\nLamanite it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try\\nall their liquors.\\n\\nAlma 55:33\\n 33 And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to\\nmake preparations to attack the city Morianton; for behold, the\\nLamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton\\nuntil it had become an exceeding stronghold.\\n\\nAlma 55:34\\n 34 And they were continually bringing new forces into that city,\\nand also new supplies of provisions.\\n\\nAlma 55:35\\n 35 And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 56\\nChapter 56\\n\\nAlma 56:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass in the commencement of the thirtieth\\nyear of the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first\\nmonth, Moroni received an epistle from Helaman, stating the\\naffairs of the people in that quarter of the land.\\n\\nAlma 56:2\\n 2 And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly\\nbeloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the\\ntribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have\\nsomewhat to tell you concerning our warfare in this part of the\\nland.\\n\\nAlma 56:3\\n 3 Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon\\nbrought down out of the land of Nephi--now ye have known that\\nthese were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our\\nfather Lehi;\\n\\nAlma 56:4\\n 4 Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions\\nor their unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these things--\\n\\nAlma 56:5\\n 5 Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of\\nthese young men have taken their weapons of war, and would that I\\nshould be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our\\ncountry.\\n\\nAlma 56:6\\n 6 And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their\\nfathers made, that they would not take up their weapons of war\\nagainst their brethren to shed blood.\\n\\nAlma 56:7\\n 7 But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our\\nafflictions and our tribulations for them, they were about to\\nbreak the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons\\nof war in our defence.\\n\\nAlma 56:8\\n 8 But I would not suffer them that they should break this\\ncovenant which they had made, supposing that God would strengthen\\nus, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the\\nfulfilling the oath which they had taken.\\n\\nAlma 56:9\\n 9 But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. \\nFor behold, in the twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march\\nat the head of these two thousand young men to the city of Judea,\\nto assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people\\nof that part of the land.\\n\\nAlma 56:10\\n 10 And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to\\nbe called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus\\ndid rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by\\nthe Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our\\nmen, for which cause we have to mourn.\\n\\nAlma 56:11\\n 11 Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that\\nthey have died in the cause of their country and of their God,\\nyea, and they are happy.\\n\\nAlma 56:12\\n 12 And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of\\nwhom are chief captains, for none other have they spared alive. \\nAnd we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of\\nNephi; it is so if they are not slain.\\n\\nAlma 56:13\\n 13 And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have\\nobtained possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of\\nour valiant men:\\n\\nAlma 56:14\\n 14 The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of\\nZeezrom, and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.\\n\\nAlma 56:15\\n 15 And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived\\nat the city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling\\nwith their might to fortify the city.\\n\\nAlma 56:16\\n 16 Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit,\\nfor they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to\\nmaintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great\\nafflictions of every kind.\\n\\nAlma 56:17\\n 17 And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die;\\ntherefore you may well suppose that this little force which I\\nbrought with me, yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes\\nand much joy.\\n\\nAlma 56:18\\n 18 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that\\nAntipus had received a greater strength to his army, they were\\ncompelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city\\nof Judea, or against us, to battle.\\n\\nAlma 56:19\\n 19 And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon\\nus in this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our\\nlittle army; but thus were we preserved.\\n\\nAlma 56:20\\n 20 They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which\\nthey had taken.  And thus ended the twenty and sixth year.  And\\nin the commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had\\nprepared our city and ourselves for defence.\\n\\nAlma 56:21\\n 21 Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us;\\nfor we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their\\nstrongholds.\\n\\nAlma 56:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to\\nwatch the movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us\\nby night nor by day to make an attack upon our other cities which\\nwere on the northward.\\n\\nAlma 56:23\\n 23 For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong\\nto meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by\\nus, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in\\nthe rear at the same time they were met in the front.  We\\nsupposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were\\ndisappointed in this our desire.\\n\\nAlma 56:24\\n 24 They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither\\ndurst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently\\nstrong and they should fall.\\n\\nAlma 56:25\\n 25 Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla;\\nneither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of\\nNephihah.\\n\\nAlma 56:26\\n 26 And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain\\nthose cities which they had taken.\\n\\nAlma 56:27\\n 27 And now it came to pass in the second month of this year,\\nthere was brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of\\nthose my two thousand sons.\\n\\nAlma 56:28\\n 28 And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the\\nland of Zarahemla.  And thus we were prepared with ten thousand\\nmen, and provisions for them, and also for their wives and their\\nchildren.\\n\\nAlma 56:29\\n 29 And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and\\nprovisions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and\\nbegan to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our\\nreceiving provisions and strength.\\n\\nAlma 56:30\\n 30 Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on\\nthis wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon\\nthem; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my\\nlittle sons to a neighboring city, as if we were carrying\\nprovisions to a neighboring city.\\n\\nAlma 56:31\\n 31 And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we\\nwere going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.\\n\\nAlma 56:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our\\nprovisions, to go to that city.\\n\\nAlma 56:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part\\nof his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city.  But he\\ndid not march forth until I had gone forth with my little army,\\nand came near the city Antiparah.\\n\\nAlma 56:34\\n 34 And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest\\narmy of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.\\n\\nAlma 56:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their\\nspies, they came forth with their army and marched against us.\\n\\nAlma 56:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward. \\nAnd thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the\\nLamanites;\\n\\nAlma 56:37\\n 37 Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they\\nsaw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did\\nnot turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in\\na straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their\\nintent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this\\nthat they might not be surrounded by our people.\\n\\nAlma 56:38\\n 38 And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of\\nhis army.  But behold, it was night; therefore they did not\\novertake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did\\ncamp for the night.\\n\\nAlma 56:39\\n 39 And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning,\\nbehold, the Lamanites were pursuing us.  Now we were not\\nsufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer\\nthat my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we\\ndid continue our march, and we took our march into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 56:40\\n 40 Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest\\nthey should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor\\nto the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand\\nagainst them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and\\nthus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it\\nwas dark.\\n\\nAlma 56:41\\n 41 And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning\\ncame we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.\\n\\nAlma 56:42\\n 42 But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before\\nthey halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the\\nseventh month.\\n\\nAlma 56:43\\n 43 And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not,\\nbut I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted\\nfor the purpose that we should come against them, that they might\\ncatch us in their snare;\\n\\nAlma 56:44\\n 44 Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to\\nbattle?\\n\\nAlma 56:45\\n 45 And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never\\nhad I seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 56:46\\n 46 For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of\\nthem very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our\\nGod is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then\\nlet us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let\\nus alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the\\narmy of Antipus.\\n\\nAlma 56:47\\n 47 Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and\\nthey did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they\\ndid upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers,\\nthat if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.\\n\\nAlma 56:48\\n 48 And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers,\\nsaying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.\\n\\nAlma 56:49\\n 49 And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand\\nagainst these Lamanites who had pursued us.  And now behold, the\\narmies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had\\ncommenced.\\n\\nAlma 56:50\\n 50 The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march\\nin so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of\\nthe Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they\\nwould have obtained their purpose.\\n\\nAlma 56:51\\n 51 For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders,\\nbecause of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of\\ntheir march--therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because\\nof the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the\\nLamanites.\\n\\nAlma 56:52\\n 52 And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and\\nbegan to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them\\nwith great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear with his two\\nthousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the\\nwhole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.\\n\\nAlma 56:53\\n 53 Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had\\nturned them about, they gathered together their men and came\\nagain upon the rear of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 56:54\\n 54 And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the\\npeople of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the\\nLamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were\\ncompelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves\\nas prisoners of war.\\n\\nAlma 56:55\\n 55 And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered\\nthemselves up unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had\\nfought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain.\\n\\nAlma 56:56\\n 56 But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them\\nfallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the\\nstrength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with\\nsuch miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they\\nfall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for\\nthis cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners\\nof war.\\n\\nAlma 56:57\\n 57 And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard\\nthem to keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we\\nsent them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of those men who\\nwere not slain of Antipus, with them; and the remainder I took\\nand joined them to my stripling Ammonites, and took our march\\nback to the city of Judea.\\n\\nAlma 57\\nChapter 57\\n\\nAlma 57:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that I received an epistle from\\nAmmoron, the king, stating that if I would deliver up those\\nprisoners of war whom we had taken that he would deliver up the\\ncity of Antiparah unto us.\\n\\nAlma 57:2\\n 2 But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our\\nforces were sufficient to take the city of Antiparah by our\\nforce; and by delivering up the prisoners for that city we should\\nsuppose ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our\\nprisoners on exchange.\\n\\nAlma 57:3\\n 3 And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange\\nprisoners; therefore we began to make preparations to go against\\nthe city of Antiparah.\\n\\nAlma 57:4\\n 4 But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to\\ntheir other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify\\nthem; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands.\\n\\nAlma 57:5\\n 5 And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the\\njudges.\\n\\nAlma 57:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the twenty and\\nninth year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an\\naddition to our army, from the land of Zarahemla, and from the\\nland round about, to the number of six thousand men, besides\\nsixty of the sons of the Ammonites who had come to join their\\nbrethren, my little band of two thousand.  And now behold, we\\nwere strong, yea, and we had also plenty of provisions brought\\nunto us.\\n\\nAlma 57:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle\\nwith the army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni.\\n\\nAlma 57:8\\n 8 And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished\\nour desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our\\nstrong force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a\\nlittle before they were to receive a supply of provisions.\\n\\nAlma 57:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for\\nmany nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards,\\nthat the Lamanites could not come upon us by night and slay us,\\nwhich they attempted many times; but as many times as they\\nattempted this their blood was spilt.\\n\\nAlma 57:10\\n 10 At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to\\nenter the city by night.  And we, instead of being Lamanites,\\nwere Nephites; therefore, we did take them and their provisions.\\n\\nAlma 57:11\\n 11 And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their\\nsupport after this manner, they were still determined to maintain\\nthe city; therefore it became expedient that we should take those\\nprovisions and send them to Judea, and our prisoners to the land\\nof Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 57:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before\\nthe Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they\\nyielded up the city unto our hands; and thus we had accomplished\\nour designs in obtaining the city Cumeni.\\n\\nAlma 57:13\\n 13 But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that,\\nnotwithstanding the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to\\nemploy all our force to keep them, or to put them to death.\\n\\nAlma 57:14\\n 14 For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would\\nfight with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they could\\nget into their hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two\\nthousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners\\nof war.\\n\\nAlma 57:15\\n 15 Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an\\nend to their lives, or guard them, sword in hand, down to the\\nland of Zarahemla; and also our provisions were not any more than\\nsufficient for our own people, notwithstanding that which we had\\ntaken from the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 57:16\\n 16 And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very\\nserious matter to determine concerning these prisoners of war;\\nnevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of\\nZarahemla; therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them\\ncharge over our prisoners to go down to the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 57:17\\n 17 But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return.  And\\nnow behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners;\\nfor behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in\\nseason to save us from falling into their hands.  For behold,\\nAmmoron had sent to their support a new supply of provisions and\\nalso a numerous army of men.\\n\\nAlma 57:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the\\nprisoners did arrive in season to check them, as they were about\\nto overpower us.\\n\\nAlma 57:19\\n 19 But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought\\nmost desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and\\ndid administer death unto all those who opposed them.\\n\\nAlma 57:20\\n 20 And as the remainder of our army were about to give way\\nbefore the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were\\nfirm and undaunted.\\n\\nAlma 57:21\\n 21 Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of\\ncommand with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it\\nwas done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said\\nunto me that their mothers had taught them.\\n\\nAlma 57:22\\n 22 And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had\\nbeen selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great\\nvictory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore\\nthey were driven back to the city of Manti.\\n\\nAlma 57:23\\n 23 And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed\\nby the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.\\n\\nAlma 57:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I\\nimmediately gave orders that my men who had been wounded should\\nbe taken from among the dead, and caused that their wounds should\\nbe dressed.\\n\\nAlma 57:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my\\ntwo thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of\\nblood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our\\ngreat astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was\\nnot one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there\\none soul among them who had not received many wounds.\\n\\nAlma 57:26\\n 26 And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole\\narmy, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand\\nof our brethren who were slain.  And we do justly ascribe it to\\nthe miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in\\nthat which they had been taught to believe--that there was a just\\nGod, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved\\nby his marvelous power.\\n\\nAlma 57:27\\n 27 Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they\\nare young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust\\nin God continually.\\n\\nAlma 57:28\\n 28 And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of\\nour wounded men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the\\nLamanites, who were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid\\nconcerning the prisoners whom they had started to go down to the\\nland of Zarahemla with.\\n\\nAlma 57:29\\n 29 Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed\\nto guard them down to the land.\\n\\nAlma 57:30\\n 30 And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold,\\nwe did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our\\nprisoners.  And it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our\\narmies, who had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 57:31\\n 31 And they cried unto us, saying--Behold, the armies of the\\nLamanites are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold,\\nthey will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people.\\n\\nAlma 57:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries,\\nwhich caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in\\nrebellion against us.\\n\\nAlma 57:33\\n 33 And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause\\nthat our swords should come upon them.  And it came to pass that\\nthey did in a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater\\nnumber of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke\\nthrough and fled from us.\\n\\nAlma 57:34\\n 34 And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake\\nthem, we took our march with speed towards the city Cumeni; and\\nbehold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren\\nin preserving the city.\\n\\nAlma 57:35\\n 35 And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our\\nenemies.  And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is\\nhe that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for\\nus.\\n\\nAlma 57:36\\n 36 Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these\\nwords of Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the\\ngoodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish;\\nyea, and I trust that the souls of them who have been slain have\\nentered into the rest of their God.\\n\\nAlma 58\\nChapter 58\\n\\nAlma 58:1\\n 1 And behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to\\nobtain the city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we\\ncould lead them out of the city by our small bands.  For behold,\\nthey remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we\\ncould not decoy them away from their strongholds.\\n\\nAlma 58:2\\n 2 And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we\\ndurst not go forth and attack them in their strongholds.\\n\\nAlma 58:3\\n 3 Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to\\nthe maintaining those parts of the land which we had regained of\\nour possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should\\nwait, that we might receive more strength from the land of\\nZarahemla and also a new supply of provisions.\\n\\nAlma 58:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the\\ngovernor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of\\nour people.  And it came to pass that we did wait to receive\\nprovisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 58:5\\n 5 But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites\\nwere also receiving great strength from day to day, and also many\\nprovisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of\\ntime.\\n\\nAlma 58:6\\n 6 And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to\\ntime, resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could\\nnot come to battle with them, because of their retreats and their\\nstrongholds.\\n\\nAlma 58:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that we did wait in these difficult\\ncircumstances for the space of many months, even until we were\\nabout to perish for the want of food.\\n\\nAlma 58:8\\n 8 But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was\\nguarded to us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance;\\nand this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend\\nourselves and our country from falling into the hands of our\\nenemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable.\\n\\nAlma 58:9\\n 9 And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause\\nwhy they did not send more strength unto us, we knew not;\\ntherefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any\\nmeans the judgments of God should come upon our land, to our\\noverthrow and utter destruction.\\n\\nAlma 58:10\\n 10 Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he\\nwould strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our\\nenemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our\\ncities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of\\nour people.\\n\\nAlma 58:11\\n 11 Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us\\nwith assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he\\ndid speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith,\\nand did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.\\n\\nAlma 58:12\\n 12 And we did take courage with our small force which we had\\nreceived, and were fixed with a determination to conquer our\\nenemies, and to maintain our lands, and our possessions, and our\\nwives, and our children, and the cause of our liberty.\\n\\nAlma 58:13\\n 13 And thus we did go forth with all our might against the\\nLamanites, who were in the city of Manti; and we did pitch our\\ntents by the wilderness side, which was near to the city.\\n\\nAlma 58:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that on the morrow, that when the\\nLamanites saw that we were in the borders by the wilderness which\\nwas near the city, that they sent out their spies round about us\\nthat they might discover the number and the strength of our army.\\n\\nAlma 58:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that when they saw that we were not\\nstrong, according to our numbers, and fearing that we should cut\\nthem off from their support except they should come out to battle\\nagainst us and kill us, and also supposing that they could easily\\ndestroy us with their numerous hosts, therefore they began to\\nmake preparations to come out against us to battle.\\n\\nAlma 58:16\\n 16 And when we saw that they were making preparations to come\\nout against us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a small number of\\nmen, should secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that\\nTeomner and a small number of men should secrete themselves also\\nin the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 58:17\\n 17 Now Gid and his men were on the right and the others on the\\nleft; and when they had thus secreted themselves, behold, I\\nremained, with the remainder of my army, in that same place where\\nwe had first pitched our tents against the time that the\\nLamanites should come out to battle.\\n\\nAlma 58:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with\\ntheir numerous army against us.  And when they had come and were\\nabout to fall upon us with the sword, I caused that my men, those\\nwho were with me, should retreat into the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 58:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us\\nwith great speed, for they were exceedingly desirous to overtake\\nus that they might slay us; therefore they did follow us into the\\nwilderness; and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and Teomner,\\ninsomuch that they were not discovered by the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 58:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had passed by, or\\nwhen the army had passed by, Gid and Teomner did rise up from\\ntheir secret places, and did cut off the spies of the Lamanites\\nthat they should not return to the city.\\n\\nAlma 58:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that when they had cut them off, they ran\\nto the city and fell upon the guards who were left to guard the\\ncity, insomuch that they did destroy them and did take possession\\nof the city.\\nAlma 58:22\\n 22 Now this was done because the Lamanites did suffer their\\nwhole army, save a few guards only, to be led away into the\\nwilderness.\\n\\nAlma 58:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that Gid and Teomner by this means had\\nobtained possession of their strongholds.  And it came to pass\\nthat we took our course, after having traveled much in the\\nwilderness towards the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nAlma 58:24\\n 24 And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards\\nthe land of Zarahemla, they were exceedingly afraid, lest there\\nwas a plan laid to lead them on to destruction; therefore they\\nbegan to retreat into the wilderness again, yea, even back by the\\nsame way which they had come.\\n\\nAlma 58:25\\n 25 And behold, it was night and they did pitch their tents, for\\nthe chief captains of the Lamanites had supposed that the\\nNephites were weary because of their march; and supposing that\\nthey had driven their whole army therefore they took no thought\\nconcerning the city of Manti.\\n\\nAlma 58:26\\n 26 Now it came to pass that when it was night, I caused that my\\nmen should not sleep, but that they should march forward by\\nanother way towards the land of Manti.\\n\\nAlma 58:27\\n 27 And because of this our march in the night-time, behold, on\\nthe morrow we were beyond the Lamanites, insomuch that we did\\narrive before them at the city of Manti.\\n\\nAlma 58:28\\n 28 And thus it came to pass, that by this stratagem we did take\\npossession of the city of Manti without the shedding of blood.\\n\\nAlma 58:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that when the armies of the Lamanites did\\narrive near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them,\\nthey were astonished exceedingly and struck with great fear,\\ninsomuch that they did flee into the wilderness.\\n\\nAlma 58:30\\n 30 Yea, and it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did\\nflee out of all this quarter of the land.  But behold, they have\\ncarried with them many women and children out of the land.\\n\\nAlma 58:31\\n 31 And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all\\nof them are at this period of time in our possession; and our\\nfathers and our women and our children are returning to their\\nhomes, all save it be those who have been taken prisoners and\\ncarried off by the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 58:32\\n 32 But behold, our armies are small to maintain so great a\\nnumber of cities and so great possessions.\\n\\nAlma 58:33\\n 33 But behold, we trust in our God who has given us victory over\\nthose lands, insomuch that we have obtained those cities and\\nthose lands, which were our own.\\n\\nAlma 58:34\\n 34 Now we do not know the cause that the government does not\\ngrant us more strength; neither do those men who came up unto us\\nknow why we have not received greater strength.\\n\\nAlma 58:35\\n 35 Behold, we do not know but what ye are unsuccessful, and ye\\nhave drawn away the forces into that quarter of the land; if so,\\nwe do not desire to murmur.\\n\\nAlma 58:36\\n 36 And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some\\nfaction in the government, that they do not send more men to our\\nassistance; for we know that they are more numerous than that\\nwhich they have sent.\\n\\nAlma 58:37\\n 37 But, behold, it mattereth not--we trust God will deliver us,\\nnotwithstanding the weakness of our armies, yea, and deliver us\\nout of the hands of our enemies.\\n\\nAlma 58:38\\n 38 Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end,\\nand we are in the possession of our lands; and the Lamanites have\\nfled to the land of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 58:39\\n 39 And those sons of the people of Ammon, of whom I have so\\nhighly spoken, are with me in the city of Manti; and the Lord had\\nsupported them, yea, and kept them from falling by the sword,\\ninsomuch that even one soul has not been slain.\\n\\nAlma 58:40\\n 40 But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they\\nstand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and\\nthey are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day;\\nyea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and\\nhis commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the\\nprophecies concerning that which is to come.\\n\\nAlma 58:41\\n 41 And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God,\\nwho has redeemed us and made us free, keep you continually in his\\npresence; yea, and may he favor this people, even that ye may\\nhave success in obtaining the possession of all that which the\\nLamanites have taken from us, which was for our support.  And\\nnow, behold, I close mine epistle.  I am Helaman, the son of\\nAlma.\\n\\nAlma 59\\nChapter 59\\n\\nAlma 59:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi, after Moroni had received and\\nhad read Helaman's epistle, he was exceedingly rejoiced because\\nof the welfare, yea, the exceeding success which Helaman had had,\\nin obtaining those lands which were lost.\\n\\nAlma 59:2\\n 2 Yea, and he did make it known unto all his people, in all the\\nland round about in that part where he was, that they might\\nrejoice also.\\n\\nAlma 59:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle to\\nPahoran, desiring that he should cause men to be gathered\\ntogether to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman,\\ninsomuch that he might with ease maintain that part of the land\\nwhich he had been so miraculously prospered in regaining.\\n\\nAlma 59:4\\n 4 And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the\\nland of Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan that he might\\nobtain the remainder of those possessions and cities which the\\nLamanites had taken from them.\\n\\nAlma 59:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making\\npreparations to go against the Lamanites to battle, behold, the\\npeople of Nephihah, who were gathered together from the city of\\nMoroni and the city of Lehi and the city of Morianton, were\\nattacked by the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 59:6\\n 6 Yea, even those who had been compelled to flee from the land\\nof Manti, and from the land round about, had come over and joined\\nthe Lamanites in this part of the land.\\n\\nAlma 59:7\\n 7 And thus being exceedingly numerous, yea, and receiving\\nstrength from day to day, by the command of Ammoron they came\\nforth against the people of Nephihah, and they did begin to slay\\nthem with an exceedingly great slaughter.\\n\\nAlma 59:8\\n 8 And their armies were so numerous that the remainder of the\\npeople of Nephihah were obliged to flee before them; and they\\ncame even and joined the army of Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 59:9\\n 9 And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent\\nto the city Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain\\nthat city, and knowing that it was easier to keep the city from\\nfalling into the hands of the Lamanites than to retake it from\\nthem, he supposed that they would easily maintain that city.\\n\\nAlma 59:10\\n 10 Therefore he retained all his force to maintain those places\\nwhich he had recovered.\\n\\nAlma 59:11\\n 11 And now, when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah was lost\\nhe was exceedingly sorrowful, and began to doubt, because of the\\nwickedness of the people, whether they should not fall into the\\nhands of their brethren.\\n\\nAlma 59:12\\n 12 Now this was the case with all his chief captains.  They\\ndoubted and marveled also because of the wickedness of the\\npeople, and this because of the success of the Lamanites over\\nthem.\\n\\nAlma 59:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the\\ngovernment, because of their indifference concerning the freedom\\nof their country.\\n\\nAlma 60\\nChapter 60\\n\\nAlma 60:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that he wrote again to the governor of the\\nland, who was Pahoran, and these are the words which he wrote,\\nsaying: Behold, I direct mine epistle to Pahoran, in the city of\\nZarahemla, who is the chief judge and the governor over the land,\\nand also to all those who have been chosen by this people to\\ngovern and manage the affairs of this war.\\n\\nAlma 60:2\\n 2 For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of\\ncondemnation; for behold, ye yourselves know that ye have been\\nappointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and\\nwith cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war of every kind,\\nand send forth against the Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they\\nshould come into our land.\\n\\nAlma 60:3\\n 3 And now behold, I say unto you that myself, and also my men,\\nand also Helaman and his men, have suffered exceedingly great\\nsufferings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all manner\\nof afflictions of every kind.\\n\\nAlma 60:4\\n 4 But behold, were this all we had suffered we would not murmur\\nnor complain.\\n\\nAlma 60:5\\n 5 But behold, great has been the slaughter among our people;\\nyea, thousands have fallen by the sword, while it might have\\notherwise been if ye had rendered unto our armies sufficient\\nstrength and succor for them.  Yea, great has been your neglect\\ntowards us.\\n\\nAlma 60:6\\n 6 And now behold, we desire to know the cause of this\\nexceedingly great neglect; yea, we desire to know the cause of\\nyour thoughtless state.\\n\\nAlma 60:7\\n 7 Can you think to sit upon your thrones in a state of\\nthoughtless stupor, while your enemies are spreading the work of\\ndeath around you?  Yea, while they are murdering thousands of\\nyour brethren--\\n\\nAlma 60:8\\n 8 Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea,\\nhave placed you in a situation that ye might have succored them,\\nyea, ye might have sent armies unto them, to have strengthened\\nthem, and have saved thousands of them from falling by the sword.\\n\\nAlma 60:9\\n 9 But behold, this is not all--ye have withheld your provisions\\nfrom them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their\\nlives because of their great desires which they had for the\\nwelfare of this people; yea, and this they have done when they\\nwere about to perish with hunger, because of your exceedingly\\ngreat neglect towards them.\\n\\nAlma 60:10\\n 10 And now, my beloved brethren--for ye ought to be beloved;\\nyea, and ye ought to have stirred yourselves more diligently for\\nthe welfare and the freedom of this people; but behold, ye have\\nneglected them insomuch that the blood of thousands shall come\\nupon your heads for vengeance; yea, for known unto God were all\\ntheir cries, and all their sufferings--\\n\\nAlma 60:11\\n 11 Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones,\\nand because of the exceeding goodness of God ye could do nothing\\nand he would deliver you?  Behold, if ye have supposed this ye\\nhave supposed in vain.\\n\\nAlma 60:12\\n 12 Do ye suppose that, because so many of your brethren have\\nbeen killed it is because of their wickedness?  I say unto you,\\nif ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain; for I say unto\\nyou, there are many who have fallen by the sword; and behold it\\nis to your condemnation;\\n\\nAlma 60:13\\n 13 For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his\\njustice and judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need\\nnot suppose that the righteous are lost because they are slain;\\nbut behold, they do enter into the rest of the Lord their God.\\n\\nAlma 60:14\\n 14 And now behold, I say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the\\njudgments of God will come upon this people, because of their\\nexceeding slothfulness, yea, even the slothfulness of our\\ngovernment, and their exceedingly great neglect towards their\\nbrethren, yea, towards those who have been slain.\\n\\nAlma 60:15\\n 15 For were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at\\nour head, we could have withstood our enemies that they could\\nhave gained no power over us.\\n\\nAlma 60:16\\n 16 Yea, had it not been for the war which broke out among\\nourselves; yea, were it not for these king-men, who caused so\\nmuch bloodshed among ourselves; yea, at the time we were\\ncontending among ourselves, if we had united our strength as we\\nhitherto have done; yea, had it not been for the desire of power\\nand authority which those king-men had over us; had they been\\ntrue to the cause of our freedom, and united with us, and gone\\nforth against our enemies, instead of taking up their swords\\nagainst us, which was the cause of so much bloodshed among\\nourselves; yea, if we had gone forth against them in the strength\\nof the Lord, we should have dispersed our enemies, for it would\\nhave been done, according to the fulfilling of his word.\\n\\nAlma 60:17\\n 17 But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking\\npossession of our lands, and they are murdering our people with\\nthe sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying\\nthem away captive, causing them that they should suffer all\\nmanner of afflictions, and this because of the great wickedness\\nof those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those\\nking-men.\\n\\nAlma 60:18\\n 18 But why should I say much concerning this matter?  For we\\nknow not but what ye yourselves are seeking for authority.  We\\nknow not but what ye are also traitors to your country.\\n\\nAlma 60:19\\n 19 Or is it that ye have neglected us because ye are in the\\nheart of our country and ye are surrounded by security, that ye\\ndo not cause food to be sent unto us, and also men to strengthen\\nour armies?\\n\\nAlma 60:20\\n 20 Have ye forgotten the commandments of the Lord your God? \\nYea, have ye forgotten the captivity of our fathers?  Have ye\\nforgotten the many times we have been delivered out of the hands\\nof our enemies?\\n\\nAlma 60:21\\n 21 Or do ye suppose that the Lord will still deliver us, while\\nwe sit upon our thrones and do not make use of the means which\\nthe Lord has provided for us?\\n\\nAlma 60:22\\n 22 Yea, will ye sit in idleness while ye are surrounded with\\nthousands of those, yea, and tens of thousands, who do also sit\\nin idleness, while there are thousands round about in the borders\\nof the land who are falling by the sword, yea, wounded and\\nbleeding?\\n\\nAlma 60:23\\n 23 Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while\\nye sit still and behold these things?  Behold I say unto you,\\nNay.  Now I would that ye should remember that God has said that\\nthe inward vessel shall be cleansed first, and then shall the\\nouter vessel be cleansed also.\\n\\nAlma 60:24\\n 24 And now, except ye do repent of that which ye have done, and\\nbegin to be up and doing, and send forth food and men unto us,\\nand also unto Helaman, that he may support those parts of our\\ncountry which he has regained, and that we may also recover the\\nremainder of our possessions in these parts, behold it will be\\nexpedient that we contend no more with the Lamanites until we\\nhave first cleansed our inward vessel, yea, even the great head\\nof our government.\\n\\nAlma 60:25\\n 25 And except ye grant mine epistle, and come out and show unto\\nme a true spirit of freedom, and strive to strengthen and fortify\\nour armies, and grant unto them food for their support, behold I\\nwill leave a part of my freemen to maintain this part of our\\nland, and I will leave the strength and the blessings of God upon\\nthem, that none other power can operate against them--\\n\\nAlma 60:26\\n 26 And this because of their exceeding faith, and their patience\\nin their tribulations--\\n\\nAlma 60:27\\n 27 And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that\\nhas a desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of\\nfreedom remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections among you,\\neven until those who have desires to usurp power and authority\\nshall become extinct.\\n\\nAlma 60:28\\n 28 Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but\\nit is my God whom I fear; and it is according to his commandments\\nthat I do take my sword to defend the cause of my country, and it\\nis because of your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss.\\n\\nAlma 60:29\\n 29 Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except\\nye do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your\\nlittle ones, the sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it\\nshall fall upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction.\\n\\nAlma 60:30\\n 30 Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do\\nadminister unto our relief, behold, I come unto you, even in the\\nland of Zarahemla, and smite you with the sword, insomuch that ye\\ncan have no more power to impede the progress of this people in\\nthe cause of our freedom.\\n\\nAlma 60:31\\n 31 For behold, the Lord will not suffer that ye shall live and\\nwax strong in your iniquities to destroy his righteous people.\\n\\nAlma 60:32\\n 32 Behold, can you suppose that the Lord will spare you and come\\nout in judgment against the Lamanites, when it is the tradition\\nof their fathers that has caused their hatred, yea, and it has\\nbeen redoubled by those who have dissented from us, while your\\niniquity is for the cause of your love of glory and the vain\\nthings of the world?\\n\\nAlma 60:33\\n 33 Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know\\nthat ye do trample them under your feet.  Behold, the Lord saith\\nunto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not\\nrepent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle\\nagainst them.\\n\\nAlma 60:34\\n 34 And now behold, I, Moroni, am constrained, according to the\\ncovenant which I have made to keep the commandments of my God;\\ntherefore I would that ye should adhere to the word of God, and\\nsend speedily unto me of your provisions and of your men, and\\nalso to Helaman.\\n\\nAlma 60:35\\n 35 And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily;\\nfor behold, God will not suffer that we should perish with\\nhunger; therefore he will give unto us of your food, even if it\\nmust be by the sword.  Now see that ye fulfil the word of God.\\n\\nAlma 60:36\\n 36 Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain.  I seek not for\\npower, but to pull it down.  I seek not for honor of the world,\\nbut for the glory of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my\\ncountry.  And thus I close mine epistle.\\n\\nAlma 61\\nChapter 61\\n\\nAlma 61:1\\n 1 Behold, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent\\nhis epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from\\nPahoran, the chief governor.  And these are the words which he\\nreceived:\\n\\nAlma 61:2\\n 2 I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send\\nthese words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. \\nBehold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great\\nafflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.\\n\\nAlma 61:3\\n 3 But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions,\\nyea, insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me,\\nand also those of my people who are freemen, yea, and those who\\nhave risen up are exceedingly numerous.\\n\\nAlma 61:4\\n 4 And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat\\nfrom me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they\\nhave used great flattery, and they have led away the hearts of\\nmany people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us;\\nthey have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen\\nthat they have not come unto you.\\n\\nAlma 61:5\\n 5 And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have\\nfled to the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were possible\\nthat I could get.\\n\\nAlma 61:6\\n 6 And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of\\nthe land; and behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their\\narms, in the defence of their country and their freedom, and to\\navenge our wrongs.\\n\\nAlma 61:7\\n 7 And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen\\nup in rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch\\nthat they do fear us and durst not come out against us to battle.\\n\\nAlma 61:8\\n 8 They have got possession of the land, or the city, of\\nZarahemla; they have appointed a king over them, and he hath\\nwritten unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath\\njoined an alliance with him; in the which alliance he hath agreed\\nto maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth\\nwill enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land,\\nand he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be\\nconquered under the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 61:9\\n 9 And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it\\nmattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of\\nyour heart.  I, Pahoran, do not seek for power, save only to\\nretain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the rights and the\\nliberty of my people.  My soul standeth fast in that liberty in\\nthe which God hath made us free.\\n\\nAlma 61:10\\n 10 And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto\\nbloodshed.  We would not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they\\nwould stay in their own land.\\n\\nAlma 61:11\\n 11 We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not\\nrise up in rebellion and take the sword against us.\\n\\nAlma 61:12\\n 12 We would subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were\\nrequisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so\\nto do.\\n\\nAlma 61:13\\n 13 But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject\\nourselves to our enemies, but that we should put our trust in\\nhim, and he will deliver us.\\n\\nAlma 61:14\\n 14 Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil,\\nand whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as\\nrebellions and dissensions, let us resist them with our swords,\\nthat we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great\\nprivilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our\\nGod.\\n\\nAlma 61:15\\n 15 Therefore, come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and\\nleave the remainder in the charge of Lehi and Teancum; give unto\\nthem power to conduct the war in that part of the land, according\\nto the Spirit of God, which is also the Spirit of freedom which\\nis in them.\\n\\nAlma 61:16\\n 16 Behold I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may\\nnot perish until ye can come unto me.\\n\\nAlma 61:17\\n 17 Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march\\nhither, and we will go speedily against those dissenters, in the\\nstrength of our God according to the faith which is in us.\\n\\nAlma 61:18\\n 18 And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we\\nmay obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we\\nwill go forth against them in the strength of the Lord, and we\\nwill put an end to this great iniquity.\\n\\nAlma 61:19\\n 19 And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I\\nwas somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it\\nshould be just in us to go against our brethren.\\n\\nAlma 61:20\\n 20 But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded\\nyou that ye should go against them.\\n\\nAlma 61:21\\n 21 See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell\\nthem to fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all\\nthose who stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made them\\nfree.  And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother,\\nMoroni.\\n\\nAlma 62\\nChapter 62\\n\\nAlma 62:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this\\nepistle his heart did take courage, and was filled with\\nexceedingly great joy because of the faithfulness of Pahoran,\\nthat he was not also a traitor to the freedom and cause of his\\ncountry.\\n\\nAlma 62:2\\n 2 But he did also mourn exceedingly because of the iniquity of\\nthose who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine\\nbecause of those who had rebelled against their country and also\\ntheir God.\\n\\nAlma 62:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men,\\naccording to the desire of Pahoran, and gave Lehi and Teancum\\ncommand over the remainder of his army, and took his march\\ntowards the land of Gideon.\\n\\nAlma 62:4\\n 4 And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place\\nhe did enter, and gained whatsoever force he could in all his\\nmarch towards the land of Gideon.\\n\\nAlma 62:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that thousands did flock unto his\\nstandard, and did take up their swords in the defence of their\\nfreedom, that they might not come into bondage.\\n\\nAlma 62:6\\n 6 And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he\\ncould in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and\\nuniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became exceedingly\\nstrong, even stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the king of\\nthose dissenters who had driven the freemen out of the land of\\nZarahemla and had taken possession of the land.\\n\\nAlma 62:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with\\ntheir armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against\\nthe city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did\\ncome to battle.\\n\\nAlma 62:8\\n 8 And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners,\\nand Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.\\n\\nAlma 62:9\\n 9 And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the\\nlaw, and also those king-men who had been taken and cast into\\nprison; and they were executed according to the law; yea, those\\nmen of Pachus and those king-men, whosoever would not take up\\narms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it,\\nwere put to death.\\n\\nAlma 62:10\\n 10 And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly\\nobserved for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was\\nfound denying their freedom was speedily executed according to\\nthe law.\\n\\nAlma 62:11\\n 11 And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges\\nover the people of Nephi; Moroni and Pahoran having restored\\npeace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, having\\ninflicted death upon all those who were not true to the cause of\\nfreedom.\\n\\nAlma 62:12\\n 12 And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and\\nfirst year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi,\\nMoroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and\\nalso an army of six thousand men should be sent unto Helaman, to\\nassist him in preserving that part of the land.\\n\\nAlma 62:13\\n 13 And he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a\\nsufficient quantity of food, should be sent to the armies of Lehi\\nand Teancum.  And it came to pass that this was done to fortify\\nthe land against the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 62:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran, leaving a large\\nbody of men in the land of Zarahemla, took their march with a\\nlarge body of men towards the land of Nephihah, being determined\\nto overthrow the Lamanites in that city.\\n\\nAlma 62:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that as they were marching towards the\\nland, they took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew\\nmany of them, and took their provisions and their weapons of war.\\n\\nAlma 62:16\\n 16 And it came to pass after they had taken them, they caused\\nthem to enter into a covenant that they would no more take up\\ntheir weapons of war against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 62:17\\n 17 And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them\\nto dwell with the people of Ammon, and they were in number about\\nfour thousand who had not been slain.\\n\\nAlma 62:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they\\npursued their march towards the land of Nephihah.  And it came to\\npass that when they had come to the city of Nephihah, they did\\npitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the\\ncity of Nephihah.\\n\\nAlma 62:19\\n 19 Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to\\nbattle against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing\\nof their exceedingly great courage, and beholding the greatness\\nof their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them;\\ntherefore they did not come to battle in that day.\\n\\nAlma 62:20\\n 20 And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of\\nthe night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what\\npart of the city the Lamanites did camp with their army.\\n\\nAlma 62:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the\\nentrance; and they were all asleep.  And now Moroni returned to\\nhis army, and caused that they should prepare in haste strong\\ncords and ladders, to be let down from the top of the wall into\\nthe inner part of the wall.\\n\\nAlma 62:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should\\nmarch forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves\\ndown into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the\\nLamanites did not camp with their armies.\\n\\nAlma 62:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city\\nby night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders;\\nthus when the morning came they were all within the walls of the\\ncity.\\n\\nAlma 62:24\\n 24 And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of\\nMoroni were within the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly,\\ninsomuch that they did flee out by the pass.\\n\\nAlma 62:25\\n 25 And now when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he\\ndid cause that his men should march forth against them, and slew\\nmany, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and\\nthe remainder of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in\\nthe borders by the seashore.\\n\\nAlma 62:26\\n 26 Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the possession of the\\ncity of Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were\\nmany of the Lamanites who were slain.\\n\\nAlma 62:27\\n 27 Now it came to pass that many of the Lamanites that were\\nprisoners were desirous to join the people of Ammon and become a\\nfree people.\\n\\nAlma 62:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that as many as were desirous, unto them\\nit was granted according to their desires.\\n\\nAlma 62:29\\n 29 Therefore, all the prisoners of the Lamanites did join the\\npeople of Ammon, and did begin to labor exceedingly, tilling the\\nground, raising all manner of grain, and flocks and herds of\\nevery kind; and thus were the Nephites relieved from a great\\nburden; yea, insomuch that they were relieved from all the\\nprisoners of the Lamanites.\\n\\nAlma 62:30\\n 30 Now it came to pass that Moroni, after he had obtained\\npossession of the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners,\\nwhich did reduce the armies of the Lamanites exceedingly, and\\nhaving regained many of the Nephites who had been taken\\nprisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni exceedingly;\\ntherefore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land\\nof Lehi.\\n\\nAlma 62:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni\\nwas coming against them, they were again frightened and fled\\nbefore the army of Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 62:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that Moroni and his army did pursue them\\nfrom city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and\\nthe Lamanites fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the\\nborders by the seashore, until they came to the land of Moroni.\\n\\nAlma 62:33\\n 33 And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together,\\ninsomuch that they were all in one body in the land of Moroni.  \\nNow, Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them.\\n\\nAlma 62:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that Moroni and Lehi and Teancum did\\nencamp with their armies round about in the borders of the land\\nof Moroni, insomuch that the Lamanites were encircled about in\\nthe borders by the wilderness on the south, and in the borders by\\nthe wilderness on the east.\\n\\nAlma 62:35\\n 35 And thus they did encamp for the night.  For behold, the\\nNephites and the Lamanites also were weary because of the\\ngreatness of the march; therefore they did not resolve upon any\\nstratagem in the night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was\\nexceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered that\\nAmmoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the cause of this\\ngreat and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had\\nbeen the cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much\\nfamine.\\n\\nAlma 62:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that Teancum in his anger did go forth\\ninto the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the\\nwalls of the city.  And he went forth with a cord, from place to\\nplace, insomuch that he did find the king; and he did cast a\\njavelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart.  But behold,\\nthe king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that\\nthey did pursue Teancum, and slew him.\\n\\nAlma 62:37\\n 37 Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that\\nTeancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he\\nhad been a man who had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a\\ntrue friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly\\nsore afflictions.  But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way\\nof all the earth.\\n\\nAlma 62:38\\n 38 Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow,\\nand came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them\\nwith a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land;\\nand they did flee, even that they did not return at that time\\nagainst the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 62:39\\n 39 And thus ended the thirty and first year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi; and thus they had had wars, and\\nbloodsheds, and famine, and affliction, for the space of many\\nyears.\\n\\nAlma 62:40\\n 40 And there had been murders, and contentions, and dissensions,\\nand all manner of iniquity among the people of Nephi;\\nnevertheless for the righteous' sake, yea, because of the prayers\\nof the righteous, they were spared.\\n\\nAlma 62:41\\n 41 But behold, because of the exceedingly great length of the\\nwar between the Nephites and the Lamanites many had become\\nhardened, because of the exceedingly great length of the war; and\\nmany were softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that\\nthey did humble themselves before God, even in the depth of\\nhumility.\\n\\nAlma 62:42\\n 42 And it came to pass that after Moroni had fortified those\\nparts of the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until\\nthey were sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of\\nZarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the place of his\\ninheritance; and there was once more peace established among the\\npeople of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 62:43\\n 43 And Moroni yielded up the command of his armies into the\\nhands of his son, whose name was Moronihah; and he retired to his\\nown house that he might spend the remainder of his days in peace.\\n\\nAlma 62:44\\n 44 And Pahoran did return to his judgment-seat; and Helaman did\\ntake upon him again to preach unto the people the word of God;\\nfor because of so many wars and contentions it had become\\nexpedient that a regulation should be made again in the church.\\n\\nAlma 62:45\\n 45 Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth, and did\\ndeclare the word of God with much power unto the convincing of\\nmany people of their wickedness, which did cause them to repent\\nof their sins and to be baptized unto the Lord their God.\\n\\nAlma 62:46\\n 46 And it came to pass that they did establish again the church\\nof God, throughout all the land.\\n\\nAlma 62:47\\n 47 Yea, and regulations were made concerning the law.  And their\\njudges, and their chief judges were chosen.\\n\\nAlma 62:48\\n 48 And the people of Nephi began to prosper again in the land,\\nand began to multiply and to wax exceedingly strong again in the\\nland.  And they began to grow exceedingly rich.\\n\\nAlma 62:49\\n 49 But notwithstanding their riches, or their strength, or their\\nprosperity, they were not lifted up in the pride of their eyes;\\nneither were they slow to remember the Lord their God; but they\\ndid humble themselves exceedingly before him.\\n\\nAlma 62:50\\n 50 Yea, they did remember how great things the Lord had done for\\nthem, that he had delivered them from death, and from bonds, and\\nfrom prisons, and from all manner of afflictions and he had\\ndelivered them out of the hands of their enemies.\\n\\nAlma 62:51\\n 51 And they did pray unto the Lord their God continually,\\ninsomuch that the Lord did bless them, according to his word, so\\nthat they did wax strong and prosper in the land.\\n\\nAlma 62:52\\n 52 And it came to pass that all these things were done.  And\\nHelaman died, in the thirty and fifth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 63\\nChapter 63\\n\\nAlma 63:1\\n 1 And it came to pass in the commencement of the thirty and\\nsixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi,\\nthat Shiblon took possession of those sacred things which had\\nbeen delivered unto Helaman by Alma.\\n\\nAlma 63:2\\n 2 And he was a just man, and he did walk uprightly before God;\\nand he did observe to do good continually, to keep the\\ncommandments of the Lord his God; and also did his brother.\\n\\nAlma 63:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that Moroni died also.  And thus ended the\\nthirty and sixth year of the reign of the judges.\\n\\nAlma 63:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that in the thirty and seventh year of the\\nreign of the judges, there was a large company of men, even to\\nthe amount of five thousand and four hundred men, with their\\nwives and their children, departed out of the land of Zarahemla\\ninto the land which was northward.\\n\\nAlma 63:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly\\ncurious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly\\nlarge ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land\\nDesolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the\\nnarrow neck which led into the land northward.\\n\\nAlma 63:6\\n 6 And behold, there were many of the Nephites who did enter\\ntherein and did sail forth with much provisions, and also many\\nwomen and children; and they took their course northward.  And\\nthus ended the thirty and seventh year.\\n\\nAlma 63:7\\n 7 And in the thirty and eighth year, this man built other ships.\\n\\nAnd the first ship did also return, and many more people did\\nenter into it; and they also took much provisions, and set out\\nagain to the land northward.\\n\\nAlma 63:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that they were never heard of more.  And\\nwe suppose that they were drowned in the depths of the sea.  And\\nit came to pass that one other ship also did sail forth; and\\nwhither she did go we know not.\\n\\nAlma 63:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that in this year there were many people\\nwho went forth into the land northward.  And thus ended the\\nthirty and eighth year.\\n\\nAlma 63:10\\n 10 And it came to pass in the thirty and ninth year of the reign\\nof the judges, Shiblon died also, and Corianton had gone forth to\\nthe land northward in a ship, to carry forth provisions unto the\\npeople who had gone forth into that land.\\n\\nAlma 63:11\\n 11 Therefore it became expedient for Shiblon to confer those\\nsacred things, before his death, upon the son of Helaman, who was\\ncalled Helaman, being called after the name of his father.\\n\\nAlma 63:12\\n 12 Now behold, all those engravings which were in the possession\\nof Helaman were written and sent forth among the children of men\\nthroughout all the land, save it were those parts which had been\\ncommanded by Alma should not go forth.\\n\\nAlma 63:13\\n 13 Nevertheless, these things were to be kept sacred, and handed\\ndown from one generation to another; therefore, in this year,\\nthey had been conferred upon Helaman, before the death of\\nShiblon.\\n\\nAlma 63:14\\n 14 And it came to pass also in this year that there were some\\ndissenters who had gone forth unto the Lamanites; and they were\\nstirred up again to anger against the Nephites.\\n\\nAlma 63:15\\n 15 And also in this same year they came down with a numerous\\narmy to war against the people of Moronihah, or against the army\\nof Moronihah, in the which they were beaten and driven back again\\nto their own lands, suffering great loss.\\n\\nAlma 63:16\\n 16 And thus ended the thirty and ninth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nAlma 63:17\\n 17 And thus ended the account of Alma, and Helaman his son, and\\nalso Shiblon, who was his son.\\n\\nHelaman\\nTHE BOOK OF HELAMAN\\nAn account of the Nephites.  Their wars and contentions, and\\ntheir dissensions.  And also the prophecies of many holy\\nprophets, before the coming of Christ, according to the records\\nof Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, and also according to the\\nrecords of his sons, even down to the coming of Christ.  And also\\nmany of the Lamanites are converted.  An account of their\\nconversion.  An account of the righteousness of the Lamanites,\\nand the wickedness and abominations of the Nephites, according to\\nthe record of Helaman and his sons, even down to the coming of\\nChrist, which is called the book of Helaman.\\n\\nHelaman 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\nHelaman 1:1\\n 1 And now behold, it came to pass in the commencement of the\\nfortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of\\nNephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of\\nthe Nephites.\\n\\nHelaman 1:2\\n 2 For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the\\nearth; therefore there began to be a serious contention\\nconcerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren,\\nwho were the sons of Pahoran.\\n\\nHelaman 1:3\\n 3 Now these are their names who did contend for the\\njudgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran,\\nPaanchi, and Pacumeni.\\n\\nHelaman 1:4\\n 4 Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran, (for he had many)\\nbut these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat;\\ntherefore, they did cause three divisions among the people.\\n\\nHelaman 1:5\\n 5 Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by\\nthe voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the\\npeople of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 1:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could\\nnot obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite with the voice of the\\npeople.\\n\\nHelaman 1:7\\n 7 But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were\\ndesirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth;\\ntherefore, he was about to flatter away those people to rise up\\nin rebellion against their brethren.\\n\\nHelaman 1:8\\n 8 And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was\\ntaken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and\\ncondemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and\\nsought to destroy the liberty of the people.\\n\\nHelaman 1:9\\n 9 Now when those people who were desirous that he should be\\ntheir governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore\\nthey were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even\\nto the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat\\nupon the judgment-seat.\\n\\nHelaman 1:10\\n 10 And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so\\nspeedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake\\nhim.\\n\\nHelaman 1:11\\n 11 And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered\\ninto a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that\\nthey would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.\\n\\nHelaman 1:12\\n 12 Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi,\\nfor he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran.  And\\nKishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle\\nthemselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not\\nbe found; but as many as were found were condemned unto death.\\n\\nHelaman 1:13\\n 13 And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the\\nvoice of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the\\npeople, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was\\naccording to his right.  And all this was done in the fortieth\\nyear of the reign of the judges; and it had an end.\\n\\nHelaman 1:14\\n 14 And it came to pass in the forty and first year of the reign\\nof the judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an\\ninnumerable army of men, and armed them with swords, and with\\ncimeters and with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates,\\nand with breastplates, and with all manner of shields of every\\nkind.\\n\\nHelaman 1:15\\n 15 And they came down again that they might pitch battle against\\nthe Nephites.  And they were led by a man whose name was\\nCoriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a\\ndissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a\\nmighty man.\\n\\nHelaman 1:16\\n 16 Therefore, the king of the Lamanites, whose name was\\nTubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron, supposing that Coriantumr,\\nbeing a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, with his\\nstrength and also with his great wisdom, insomuch that by sending\\nhim forth he should gain power over the Nephites--\\n\\nHelaman 1:17\\n 17 Therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather\\ntogether his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their\\nleader, and did cause that they should march down to the land of\\nZarahemla to battle against the Nephites.\\n\\nHelaman 1:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so\\nmuch difficulty in the government, that they had not kept\\nsufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed\\nthat the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands\\nto attack that great city Zarahemla.\\n\\nHelaman 1:19\\n 19 But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the\\nhead of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the\\ncity, and their march was with such exceedingly great speed that\\nthere was no time for the Nephites to gather together their\\narmies.\\n\\nHelaman 1:20\\n 20 Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance\\nof the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the\\ncity, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch\\nthat they did take possession of the whole city.\\n\\nHelaman 1:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the chief judge,\\ndid flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city.  And\\nit came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall,\\ninsomuch that he died.  And thus ended the days of Pacumeni.\\n\\nHelaman 1:22\\n 22 And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the\\ncity of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before\\nthem, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison,\\nand that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in\\nall the land, his heart took courage insomuch that he was about\\nto go forth against all the land.\\n\\nHelaman 1:23\\n 23 And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did\\nmarch forth with a large army, even towards the city of\\nBountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his\\nway through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts\\nof the land.\\n\\nHelaman 1:24\\n 24 And, supposing that their greatest strength was in the center\\nof the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to\\nassemble themselves together save it were in small bodies; and in\\nthis manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the\\nearth.\\n\\nHelaman 1:25\\n 25 But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of\\nthe land gave Moronihah great advantage over them,\\nnotwithstanding the greatness of the number of the Nephites who\\nwere slain.\\n\\nHelaman 1:26\\n 26 For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst\\nnot come into the center of the land, but that they would attack\\nthe cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done;\\ntherefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should\\nmaintain those parts round about by the borders.\\n\\nHelaman 1:27\\n 27 But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to\\nhis desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and\\nhad taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and\\nwere marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying\\nthe people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children,\\ntaking possession of many cities and of many strongholds.\\n\\nHelaman 1:28\\n 28 But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent\\nforth Lehi with an army round about to head them before they\\nshould come to the land Bountiful.\\n\\nHelaman 1:29\\n 29 And thus he did; and he did head them before they came to the\\nland Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they\\nbegan to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.\\n\\nHelaman 1:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their\\nretreat, and did give unto them battle, insomuch that it became\\nan exceedingly bloody battle; yea, many were slain, and among the\\nnumber who were slain Coriantumr was also found.\\n\\nHelaman 1:31\\n 31 And now, behold, the Lamanites could not retreat either way,\\nneither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on\\nthe west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites.\\n\\nHelaman 1:32\\n 32 And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst\\nof the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the\\nNephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield\\nthemselves into the hands of the Nephites.\\n\\nHelaman 1:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the\\ncity of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites who had\\nbeen taken prisoners should depart out of the land in peace.\\n\\nHelaman 1:34\\n 34 And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the\\njudges.\\n\\nHelaman 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\nHelaman 2:1\\n 1 And it came to pass in the forty and second year of the reign\\nof the judges, after Moronihah had established again peace\\nbetween the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one\\nto fill the judgment-seat; therefore there began to be a\\ncontention again among the people concerning who should fill the\\njudgment-seat.\\n\\nHelaman 2:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of Helaman,\\nwas appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the\\npeople.\\n\\nHelaman 2:3\\n 3 But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait\\nto destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had\\nentered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness.\\n\\nHelaman 2:4\\n 4 For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in\\nmany words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of\\nmurder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band\\nof Kishkumen.\\n\\nHelaman 2:5\\n 5 Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if\\nthey would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto\\nthose who belonged to his band that they should be placed in\\npower and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought\\nto destroy Helaman.\\n\\nHelaman 2:6\\n 6 And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat\\nto destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having\\nbeen out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a\\nknowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to\\ndestroy Helaman--\\n\\nHelaman 2:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto\\nhim a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of\\nhis desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the\\njudgment-seat that he might murder Helaman.\\n\\nHelaman 2:8\\n 8 And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of\\nKishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also\\nthat it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to\\nmurder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their secret\\nplan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto\\nKishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.\\n\\nHelaman 2:9\\n 9 Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose\\nthat he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of\\nHelaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did\\nstab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a\\ngroan.  And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had\\nseen, and heard, and done.\\n\\nHelaman 2:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this\\nband of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed\\naccording to the law.\\n\\nHelaman 2:11\\n 11 But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not\\nreturn he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he\\ncaused that his band should follow him.  And they took their\\nflight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and\\nthus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be\\nfound.\\n\\nHelaman 2:12\\n 12 And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter.  And\\nthus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges\\nover the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 2:13\\n 13 And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this\\nGadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire\\ndestruction of the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 2:14\\n 14 Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I\\nmean the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all\\nthe account which I have written.\\n\\nHelaman 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\nHelaman 3:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the\\nreign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of\\nNephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which\\ndid cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs\\nwere settled in the ending of the forty and third year.\\n\\nHelaman 3:2\\n 2 And there was no contention among the people in the forty and\\nfourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and\\nfifth year.\\n\\nHelaman 3:3\\n 3 And it came to pass in the forty and sixth, yea, there was\\nmuch contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an\\nexceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla,\\nand went forth unto the land northward to inherit the land.\\n\\nHelaman 3:4\\n 4 And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch\\nthat they came to large bodies of water and many rivers.\\n\\nHelaman 3:5\\n 5 Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the\\nland, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and\\nwithout timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before\\ninherited the land.\\n\\nHelaman 3:6\\n 6 And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for\\ntimber; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the\\npeople who had before inhabited the land it was called desolate.\\n\\nHelaman 3:7\\n 7 And there being but little timber upon the face of the land,\\nnevertheless the people who went forth became exceedingly expert\\nin the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of\\ncement, in the which they did dwell.\\n\\nHelaman 3:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did\\ngo forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did\\nspread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole\\nearth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to\\nthe sea east.\\n\\nHelaman 3:9\\n 9 And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in\\ntents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever\\ntree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should\\ngrow up, that in time they might have timber to build their\\nhouses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their\\nsynagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their\\nbuildings.\\n\\nHelaman 3:10\\n 10 And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly scarce in the\\nland northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping.\\n\\nHelaman 3:11\\n 11 And thus they did enable the people in the land northward\\nthat they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.\\n\\nHelaman 3:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that there were many of the people of\\nAmmon, who were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this\\nland.\\n\\nHelaman 3:13\\n 13 And now there are many records kept of the proceedings of\\nthis people, by many of this people, which are particular and\\nvery large, concerning them.\\n\\nHelaman 3:14\\n 14 But behold, a hundredth part of the proceedings of this\\npeople, yea, the account of the Lamanites and of the Nephites,\\nand their wars, and contentions, and dissensions, and their\\npreaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping and their\\nbuilding of ships, and their building of temples, and of\\nsynagogues and their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and\\ntheir wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and\\ntheir plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms,\\ncannot be contained in this work.\\n\\nHelaman 3:15\\n 15 But behold, there are many books and many records of every\\nkind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.\\n\\nHelaman 3:16\\n 16 And they have been handed down from one generation to another\\nby the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression\\nand have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth,\\nand slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed\\nwith the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites,\\nbecoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming\\nLamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 3:17\\n 17 And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I\\nhave spoken had passed after there had been great contentions,\\nand disturbances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of\\nNephi.\\n\\nHelaman 3:18\\n 18 The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;\\n\\nHelaman 3:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that there was still great contention in\\nthe land, yea, even in the forty and seventh year, and also in\\nthe forty and eighth year.\\n\\nHelaman 3:20\\n 20 Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice\\nand equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the\\njudgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which\\nwas right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after\\nthe ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.\\n\\nHelaman 3:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that he had two sons.  He gave unto the\\neldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of\\nLehi.  And they began to grow up unto the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 3:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to\\ncease, in a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in\\nthe latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 3:23\\n 23 And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign\\nof the judges, there was continual peace established in the land,\\nall save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the\\nrobber had established in the more settled parts of the land,\\nwhich at that time were not known unto those who were at the head\\nof government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.\\n\\nHelaman 3:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that in this same year there was\\nexceedingly great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there\\nwere thousands who did join themselves unto the church and were\\nbaptized unto repentance.\\n\\nHelaman 3:25\\n 25 And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many\\nthe blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even\\nthe high priests and the teachers were themselves astonished\\nbeyond measure.\\n\\nHelaman 3:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper\\nunto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God, many souls,\\nyea, even tens of thousands.\\n\\nHelaman 3:27\\n 27 Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will,\\nin the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.\\n\\nHelaman 3:28\\n 28 Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all,\\neven to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who\\nis the Son of God.\\n\\nHelaman 3:29\\n 29 Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of\\nGod, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all\\nthe cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead\\nthe man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that\\neverlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the\\nwicked--\\n\\nHelaman 3:30\\n 30 And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right\\nhand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham,\\nand Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go\\nno more out.\\n\\nHelaman 3:31\\n 31 And in this year there was continual rejoicing in the land of\\nZarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the\\nland which was possessed by the Nephites.\\n\\nHelaman 3:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that there was peace and exceedingly\\ngreat joy in the remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and\\nalso there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year\\nof the reign of the judges.\\n\\nHelaman 3:33\\n 33 And in the fifty and first year of the reign of the judges\\nthere was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter\\ninto the church--not into the church of God, but into the hearts\\nof the people who professed to belong to the church of God--\\n\\nHelaman 3:34\\n 34 And they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of\\nmany of their brethren.  Now this was a great evil, which did\\ncause the more humble part of the people to suffer great\\npersecutions, and to wade through much affliction.\\n\\nHelaman 3:35\\n 35 Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger\\nand stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the\\nfaith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and\\nconsolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of\\ntheir hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their\\nyielding their hearts unto God.\\n\\nHelaman 3:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in\\npeace also, save it were the exceedingly great pride which had\\ngotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their\\nexceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land; and it\\ndid grow upon them from day to day.\\n\\nHelaman 3:37\\n 37 And it came to pass in the fifty and third year of the reign\\nof the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to\\nreign in his stead.  And it came to pass that he did fill the\\njudgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the\\ncommandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.\\n\\nHelaman 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\nHelaman 4:1\\n 1 And it came to pass in the fifty and fourth year there were\\nmany dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention\\namong the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.\\n\\nHelaman 4:2\\n 2 And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land,\\nand they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 4:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the\\nLamanites to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites\\nwere exceedingly afraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to\\nthe words of those dissenters.\\n\\nHelaman 4:4\\n 4 But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign\\nof the judges, there were dissenters who went up from the\\nNephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others\\nin stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were\\nall that year preparing for war.\\n\\nHelaman 4:5\\n 5 And in the fifty and seventh year they did come down against\\nthe Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death;\\nyea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of\\nthe judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of\\nZarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which\\nwas near the land Bountiful.\\n\\nHelaman 4:6\\n 6 And the Nephites and the armies of Moronihah were driven even\\ninto the land of Bountiful;\\n\\nHelaman 4:7\\n 7 And there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the\\nwest sea, even unto the east; it being a day's journey for a\\nNephite, on the line which they had fortified and stationed their\\narmies to defend their north country.\\n\\nHelaman 4:8\\n 8 And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a\\nnumerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession\\nof the Nephites which was in the land southward.  And all this\\nwas done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of\\nthe judges.\\n\\nHelaman 4:9\\n 9 And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the reign of the\\njudges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies in obtaining many\\nparts of the land; yea, they regained many cities which had\\nfallen into the hands of the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 4:10\\n 10 And it came to pass in the sixty and first year of the reign\\nof the judges they succeeded in regaining even the half of all\\ntheir possessions.\\n\\nHelaman 4:11\\n 11 Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter\\nwhich was among them, would not have happened had it not been for\\ntheir wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea,\\nand it was among those also who professed to belong to the church\\nof God.\\n\\nHelaman 4:12\\n 12 And it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of\\ntheir exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression\\nto the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding\\ntheir clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren\\nupon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying\\nthe spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering,\\nlying, stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great\\ncontentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the\\nLamanites--\\n\\nHelaman 4:13\\n 13 And because of this their great wickedness, and their\\nboastings in their own strength, they were left in their own\\nstrength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and\\nsmitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost\\npossession of almost all their lands.\\n\\nHelaman 4:14\\n 14 But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people\\nbecause of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, who were the\\nsons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people, yea, and\\ndid prophesy many things unto them concerning their iniquities,\\nand what should come unto them if they did not repent of their\\nsins.\\n\\nHelaman 4:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as\\nthey did repent they did begin to prosper.\\n\\nHelaman 4:16\\n 16 For when Moronihah saw that they did repent he did venture to\\nlead them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even\\nuntil they had regained the one-half of their property and the\\none-half of all their lands.\\n\\nHelaman 4:17\\n 17 And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the\\njudges.\\n\\nHelaman 4:18\\n 18 And it came to pass in the sixty and second year of the reign\\nof the judges, that Moronihah could obtain no more possessions\\nover the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 4:19\\n 19 Therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the\\nremainder of their lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that\\nit became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over\\nthem; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in\\nmaintaining those parts which he had taken.\\n\\nHelaman 4:20\\n 20 And it came to pass, because of the greatness of the number\\nof the Lamanites the Nephites were in great fear, lest they\\nshould be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and\\ndestroyed.\\n\\nHelaman 4:21\\n 21 Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also\\nthe words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a\\nstiffnecked people, and that they had set at naught the\\ncommandments of God.\\n\\nHelaman 4:22\\n 22 And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the\\nlaws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto\\nthe people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted,\\nand that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were\\nwicked even like unto the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 4:23\\n 23 And because of their iniquity the church had begun to\\ndwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy\\nand in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did\\nstare them in the face.\\n\\nHelaman 4:24\\n 24 And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their\\nbrethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no\\nmore preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the\\nSpirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples--\\n\\nHelaman 4:25\\n 25 Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his\\nmiraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state\\nof unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites\\nwere exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they should\\ncleave unto the Lord their God, they must unavoidably perish.\\n\\nHelaman 4:26\\n 26 For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was\\nas great as their strength, even man for man.  And thus had they\\nfallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become\\nweak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many\\nyears.\\n\\nHelaman 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\nHelaman 5:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that in this same year, behold, Nephi\\ndelivered up the judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.\\n\\nHelaman 5:2\\n 2 For as their laws and their governments were established by\\nthe voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more\\nnumerous than they who chose good, therefore they were ripening\\nfor destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.\\n\\nHelaman 5:3\\n 3 Yea, and this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people,\\ninsomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice,\\nsave it were to their destruction.\\n\\nHelaman 5:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that Nephi had become weary because of\\ntheir iniquity; and he yielded up the judgment-seat, and took it\\nupon him to preach the word of God all the remainder of his days,\\nand his brother Lehi also, all the remainder of his days;\\n\\nHelaman 5:5\\n 5 For they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake\\nunto them.  And these are the words which he spake:\\n\\nHelaman 5:6\\n 6 Behold, my sons, I desire that ye should remember to keep the\\ncommandments of God; and I would that ye should declare unto the\\npeople these words.  Behold, I have given unto you the names of\\nour first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this\\nI have done that when you remember your names ye may remember\\nthem; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and\\nwhen ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and\\nalso written, that they were good.\\n\\nHelaman 5:7\\n 7 Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is\\ngood, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it\\nhas been said and written of them.\\n\\nHelaman 5:8\\n 8 And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you,\\nwhich desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may\\nboast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a\\ntreasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not\\naway; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life,\\nwhich we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.\\n\\nHelaman 5:9\\n 9 O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin\\nspake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way\\nnor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning\\nblood of Jesus Christ, who shall come, yea, remember that he\\ncometh to redeem the world.\\n\\nHelaman 5:10\\n 10 And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom,\\nin the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord\\nsurely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not\\ncome to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their\\nsins.\\n\\nHelaman 5:11\\n 11 And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem\\nthem from their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath\\nsent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of\\nrepentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto\\nthe salvation of their souls.\\n\\nHelaman 5:12\\n 12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock\\nof our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must\\nbuild your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his\\nmighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his\\nhail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no\\npower over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless\\nwo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure\\nfoundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.\\n\\nHelaman 5:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman\\ntaught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are\\nnot written, and also many things which are written.\\n\\nHelaman 5:14\\n 14 And they did remember his words; and therefore they went\\nforth, keeping the commandments of God, to teach the word of God\\namong all the people of Nephi, beginning at the city Bountiful;\\n\\nHelaman 5:15\\n 15 And from thenceforth to the city of Gid; and from the city of\\nGid to the city of Mulek;\\n\\nHelaman 5:16\\n 16 And even from one city to another, until they had gone forth\\namong all the people of Nephi who were in the land southward; and\\nfrom thence into the land of Zarahemla, among the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 5:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that they did preach with great power,\\ninsomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters who had\\ngone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and\\ndid confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance, and\\nimmediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto\\nthem the wrongs which they had done.\\n\\nHelaman 5:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the\\nLamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power\\nand authority, given unto them that they might speak, and they\\nalso had what they should speak given unto them--\\n\\nHelaman 5:19\\n 19 Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the\\nLamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight\\nthousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and\\nround about baptized unto repentance, and were convinced of the\\nwickedness of the traditions of their fathers.\\n\\nHelaman 5:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from\\nthence to go to the land of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 5:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that they were taken by an army of the\\nLamanites and cast into prison; yea, even in that same prison in\\nwhich Ammon and his brethren were cast by the servants of Limhi.\\n\\nHelaman 5:22\\n 22 And after they had been cast into prison many days without\\nfood, behold, they went forth into the prison to take them that\\nthey might slay them.\\n\\nHelaman 5:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about\\nas if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands\\nupon them for fear lest they should be burned.  Nevertheless,\\nNephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the\\nmidst of fire and were not burned.\\n\\nHelaman 5:24\\n 24 And when they saw that they were encircled about with a\\npillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did\\ntake courage.\\n\\nHelaman 5:25\\n 25 For they saw that the Lamanites durst not lay their hands\\nupon them; neither durst they come near unto them, but stood as\\nif they were struck dumb with amazement.\\n\\nHelaman 5:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth and\\nbegan to speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for behold, it is God\\nthat has shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the which is\\nshown unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.\\n\\nHelaman 5:27\\n 27 And behold, when they had said these words, the earth shook\\nexceedingly, and the walls of the prison did shake as if they\\nwere about to tumble to the earth; but behold, they did not fall.\\n\\nAnd behold, they that were in the prison were Lamanites and\\nNephites who were dissenters.\\n\\nHelaman 5:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that they were overshadowed with a cloud\\nof darkness, and an awful solemn fear came upon them.\\n\\nHelaman 5:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that there came a voice as if it were\\nabove the cloud of darkness, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, and\\nseek no more to destroy my servants whom I have sent unto you to\\ndeclare good tidings.\\n\\nHelaman 5:30\\n 30 And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld\\nthat it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a\\ngreat tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of\\nperfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce\\neven to the very soul--\\n\\nHelaman 5:31\\n 31 And notwithstanding the mildness of the voice, behold the\\nearth shook exceedingly, and the walls of the prison trembled\\nagain, as if it were about to tumble to the earth; and behold the\\ncloud of darkness, which had overshadowed them, did not\\ndisperse--\\n\\nHelaman 5:32\\n 32 And behold the voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent\\nye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and seek no more to\\ndestroy my servants.  And it came to pass that the earth shook\\nagain, and the walls trembled.\\n\\nHelaman 5:33\\n 33 And also again the third time the voice came, and did speak\\nunto them marvelous words which cannot be uttered by man; and the\\nwalls did tremble again, and the earth shook as if it were about\\nto divide asunder.\\n\\nHelaman 5:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that the Lamanites could not flee because\\nof the cloud of darkness which did overshadow them; yea, and also\\nthey were immovable because of the fear which did come upon them.\\n\\nHelaman 5:35\\n 35 Now there was one among them who was a Nephite by birth, who\\nhad once belonged to the church of God but had dissented from\\nthem.\\n\\nHelaman 5:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he\\nsaw through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi;\\nand behold, they did shine exceedingly, even as the faces of\\nangels.  And he beheld that they did lift their eyes to heaven;\\nand they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their\\nvoices to some being whom they beheld.\\n\\nHelaman 5:37\\n 37 And it came to pass that this man did cry unto the multitude,\\nthat they might turn and look.  And behold, there was power given\\nunto them that they did turn and look; and they did behold the\\nfaces of Nephi and Lehi.\\n\\nHelaman 5:38\\n 38 And they said unto the man: Behold, what do all these things\\nmean, and who is it with whom these men do converse?\\n\\nHelaman 5:39\\n 39 Now the man's name was Aminadab.  And Aminadab said unto\\nthem: They do converse with the angels of God.\\n\\nHelaman 5:40\\n 40 And it came to pass that the Lamanites said unto him: What\\nshall we do, that this cloud of darkness may be removed from\\novershadowing us?\\n\\nHelaman 5:41\\n 41 And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent, and cry unto\\nthe voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was\\ntaught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye\\nshall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from\\novershadowing you.\\n\\nHelaman 5:42\\n 42 And it came to pass that they all did begin to cry unto the\\nvoice of him who had shaken the earth; yea, they did cry even\\nuntil the cloud of darkness was dispersed.\\n\\nHelaman 5:43\\n 43 And it came to pass that when they cast their eyes about, and\\nsaw that the cloud of darkness was dispersed from overshadowing\\nthem, behold, they saw that they were encircled about, yea every\\nsoul, by a pillar of fire.\\n\\nHelaman 5:44\\n 44 And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were\\nencircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming\\nfire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the\\nwalls of the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is\\nunspeakable and full of glory.\\n\\nHelaman 5:45\\n 45 And behold, the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven,\\nand did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as if with\\nfire, and they could speak forth marvelous words.\\n\\nHelaman 5:46\\n 46 And it came to pass that there came a voice unto them, yea, a\\npleasant voice, as if it were a whisper, saying:\\n\\nHelaman 5:47\\n 47 Peace, peace be unto you, because of your faith in my Well\\nBeloved, who was from the foundation of the world.\\n\\nHelaman 5:48\\n 48 And now, when they heard this they cast up their eyes as if\\nto behold from whence the voice came; and behold, they saw the\\nheavens open; and angels came down out of heaven and ministered\\nunto them.\\n\\nHelaman 5:49\\n 49 And there were about three hundred souls who saw and heard\\nthese things; and they were bidden to go forth and marvel not,\\nneither should they doubt.\\n\\nHelaman 5:50\\n 50 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and did minister\\nunto the people, declaring throughout all the regions round about\\nall the things which they had heard and seen, insomuch that the\\nmore part of the Lamanites were convinced of them, because of the\\ngreatness of the evidences which they had received.\\n\\nHelaman 5:51\\n 51 And as many as were convinced did lay down their weapons of\\nwar, and also their hatred and the tradition of their fathers.\\n\\nHelaman 5:52\\n 52 And it came to pass that they did yield up unto the Nephites\\nthe lands of their possession.\\n\\nHelaman 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\nHelaman 6:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that when the sixty and second year of the\\nreign of the judges had ended, all these things had happened and\\nthe Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a righteous\\npeople, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the\\nNephites because of their firmness and their steadiness in the\\nfaith.\\n\\nHelaman 6:2\\n 2 For behold, there were many of the Nephites who had become\\nhardened and impenitent and grossly wicked, insomuch that they\\ndid reject the word of God and all the preaching and prophesying\\nwhich did come among them.\\n\\nHelaman 6:3\\n 3 Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy\\nbecause of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because of the\\nchurch of God, which had been established among them.  And they\\ndid fellowship one with another and did rejoice one with another,\\nand did have great joy.\\n\\nHelaman 6:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did come down\\ninto the land of Zarahemla, and did declare unto the people of\\nthe Nephites the manner of their conversion, and did exhort them\\nto faith and repentance.\\n\\nHelaman 6:5\\n 5 Yea, and many did preach with exceedingly great power and\\nauthority, unto the bringing down many of them into the depths of\\nhumility, to be the humble followers of God and the Lamb.\\n\\nHelaman 6:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that many of the Lamanites did go into the\\nland northward; and also Nephi and Lehi went into the land\\nnorthward, to preach unto the people.  And thus ended the sixty\\nand third year.\\n\\nHelaman 6:7\\n 7 And behold, there was peace in all the land, insomuch that the\\nNephites did go into whatsoever part of the land they would,\\nwhether among the Nephites or the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 6:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did also go\\nwhithersoever they would, whether it were among the Lamanites or\\namong the Nephites; and thus they did have free intercourse one\\nwith another, to buy and to sell, and to get gain, according to\\ntheir desire.\\n\\nHelaman 6:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they became exceedingly rich, both\\nthe Lamanites and the Nephites; and they did have an exceeding\\nplenty of gold, and of silver, and of all manner of precious\\nmetals, both in the land south and in the land north.\\n\\nHelaman 6:10\\n 10 Now the land south was called Lehi and the land north was\\ncalled Mulek, which was after the son of Zedekiah; for the Lord\\ndid bring Mulek into the land north, and Lehi into the land\\nsouth.\\n\\nHelaman 6:11\\n 11 And behold, there was all manner of gold in both these lands,\\nand of silver, and of precious ore of every kind; and there were\\nalso curious workmen, who did work all kinds of ore and did\\nrefine it; and thus they did become rich.\\n\\nHelaman 6:12\\n 12 They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in\\nthe south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north\\nand in the south.  And they did multiply and wax exceedingly\\nstrong in the land.  And they did raise many flocks and herds,\\nyea, many fatlings.\\n\\nHelaman 6:13\\n 13 Behold their women did toil and spin, and did make all manner\\nof cloth, of fine-twined linen and cloth of every kind, to clothe\\ntheir nakedness.  And thus the sixty and fourth year did pass\\naway in peace.\\n\\nHelaman 6:14\\n 14 And in the sixty and fifth year they did also have great joy\\nand peace, yea, much preaching and many prophecies concerning\\nthat which was to come.  And thus passed away the sixty and fifth\\nyear.\\n\\nHelaman 6:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth year of the\\nreign of the judges, behold, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown\\nhand as he sat upon the judgment-seat.  And it came to pass that\\nin the same year, that his son, who had been appointed by the\\npeople in his stead, was also murdered.  And thus ended the sixty\\nand sixth year.\\n\\nHelaman 6:16\\n 16 And in the commencement of the sixty and seventh year the\\npeople began to grow exceedingly wicked again.\\n\\nHelaman 6:17\\n 17 For behold, the Lord had blessed them so long with the riches\\nof the world that they had not been stirred up to anger, to wars,\\nnor to bloodshed; therefore they began to set their hearts upon\\ntheir riches; yea, they began to seek to get gain that they might\\nbe lifted up one above another; therefore they began to commit\\nsecret murders, and to rob and to plunder, that they might get\\ngain.\\n\\nHelaman 6:18\\n 18 And now behold, those murderers and plunderers were a band\\nwho had been formed by Kishkumen and Gadianton.  And now it had\\ncome to pass that there were many, even among the Nephites, of\\nGadianton's band.  But behold, they were more numerous among the\\nmore wicked part of the Lamanites.  And they were called\\nGadianton's robbers and murderers.\\n\\nHelaman 6:19\\n 19 And it was they who did murder the chief judge Cezoram, and\\nhis son, while in the judgment-seat; and behold, they were not\\nfound.\\n\\nHelaman 6:20\\n 20 And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites found that\\nthere were robbers among them they were exceedingly sorrowful;\\nand they did use every means in their power to destroy them off\\nthe face of the earth.\\n\\nHelaman 6:21\\n 21 But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more part of\\nthe Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of\\nrobbers, and did enter into their covenants and their oaths, that\\nthey would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever\\ndifficult circumstances they should be placed, that they should\\nnot suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their\\nstealings.\\n\\nHelaman 6:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea,\\ntheir secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they\\nmight distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant,\\nthat whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be\\ninjured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band,\\nwho had taken this covenant.\\n\\nHelaman 6:23\\n 23 And thus they might murder, and plunder, and steal, and\\ncommit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness, contrary to the\\nlaws of their country and also the laws of their God.\\n\\nHelaman 6:24\\n 24 And whosoever of those who belonged to their band should\\nreveal unto the world of their wickedness and their abominations,\\nshould be tried, not according to the laws of their country, but\\naccording to the laws of their wickedness, which had been given\\nby Gadianton and Kishkumen.\\n\\nHelaman 6:25\\n 25 Now behold, it is these secret oaths and covenants which Alma\\ncommanded his son should not go forth unto the world, lest they\\nshould be a means of bringing down the people unto destruction.\\n\\nHelaman 6:26\\n 26 Now behold, those secret oaths and covenants did not come\\nforth unto Gadianton from the records which were delivered unto\\nHelaman; but behold, they were put into the heart of Gadianton by\\nthat same being who did entice our first parents to partake of\\nthe forbidden fruit--\\n\\nHelaman 6:27\\n 27 Yea, that same being who did plot with Cain, that if he would\\nmurder his brother Abel it should not be known unto the world. \\nAnd he did plot with Cain and his followers from that time forth.\\n\\nHelaman 6:28\\n 28 And also it is that same being who put it into the hearts of\\nthe people to build a tower sufficiently high that they might get\\nto heaven.  And it was that same being who led on the people who\\ncame from that tower into this land; who spread the works of\\ndarkness and abominations over all the face of the land, until he\\ndragged the people down to an entire destruction, and to an\\neverlasting hell.\\n\\nHelaman 6:29\\n 29 Yea, it is that same being who put it into the heart of\\nGadianton to still carry on the work of darkness, and of secret\\nmurder; and he has brought it forth from the beginning of man\\neven down to this time.\\n\\nHelaman 6:30\\n 30 And behold, it is he who is the author of all sin.  And\\nbehold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder,\\nand doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their\\ncovenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation\\nto generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the\\nchildren of men.\\n\\nHelaman 6:31\\n 31 And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the\\nNephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked;\\nyea, the more part of them had turned out of the way of\\nrighteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments\\nof God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto\\nthemselves idols of their gold and their silver.\\n\\nHelaman 6:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto\\nthem in the space of not many years, insomuch that a more part of\\nit had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign\\nof the judges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 6:33\\n 33 And they did grow in their iniquities in the sixty and eighth\\nyear also.\\n\\nHelaman 6:34\\n 34 And thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in\\nunbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the\\nLamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their\\nGod; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments,\\nand to walk in truth and uprightness before him.\\n\\nHelaman 6:35\\n 35 And thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw\\nfrom the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of\\ntheir hearts.\\n\\nHelaman 6:36\\n 36 And thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit\\nupon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to\\nbelieve in his words.\\n\\nHelaman 6:37\\n 37 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of\\nrobbers of Gadianton; and they did preach the word of God among\\nthe more wicked part of them, insomuch that this band of robbers\\nwas utterly destroyed from among the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 6:38\\n 38 And it came to pass on the other hand, that the Nephites did\\nbuild them up and support them, beginning at the more wicked part\\nof them, until they had overspread all the land of the Nephites,\\nand had seduced the more part of the righteous until they had\\ncome down to believe in their works and partake of their spoils,\\nand to join with them in their secret murders and combinations.\\n\\nHelaman 6:39\\n 39 And thus they did obtain the sole management of the\\ngovernment, insomuch that they did trample under their feet and\\nsmite and rend and turn their backs upon the poor and the meek,\\nand the humble followers of God.\\n\\nHelaman 6:40\\n 40 And thus we see that they were in an awful state, and\\nripening for an everlasting destruction.\\n\\nHelaman 6:41\\n 41 And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year\\nof the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\nHelaman 7:1\\n 1 Behold, now it came to pass in the sixty and ninth year of the\\nreign of the judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi,\\nthe son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the\\nland northward.\\n\\nHelaman 7:2\\n 2 For he had been forth among the people who were in the land\\nnorthward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did\\nprophesy many things unto them;\\n\\nHelaman 7:3\\n 3 And they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not\\nstay among them, but returned again unto the land of his\\nnativity.\\n\\nHelaman 7:4\\n 4 And seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and\\nthose Gadianton robbers filling the judgment-seats--having\\nusurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the\\ncommandments of God, and not in the least aright before him;\\ndoing no justice unto the children of men;\\n\\nHelaman 7:5\\n 5 Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness;\\nletting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their\\nmoney; and moreover to be held in office at the head of\\ngovernment, to rule and do according to their wills, that they\\nmight get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they\\nmight the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and\\ndo according to their own wills--\\n\\nHelaman 7:6\\n 6 Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the\\nspace of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was\\nswollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the\\nagony of his soul:\\n\\nHelaman 7:7\\n 7 Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father\\nNephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have\\njoyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to\\nbe entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to\\nbe led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the\\nwords of the Lord--\\n\\nHelaman 7:8\\n 8 Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my\\nsoul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.\\n\\nHelaman 7:9\\n 9 But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my\\nsoul shall be filled with sorrow because of this the wickedness\\nof my brethren.\\n\\nHelaman 7:10\\n 10 And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower,\\nwhich was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which\\nled to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla;\\ntherefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in\\nhis garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by\\nwhich led the highway.\\n\\nHelaman 7:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by\\nand saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the\\ntower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and\\nthe people came together in multitudes that they might know the\\ncause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.\\n\\nHelaman 7:12\\n 12 And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people\\nwho had gathered together.\\n\\nHelaman 7:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto\\nthem: Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together? That I\\nmay tell you of your iniquities?\\n\\nHelaman 7:14\\n 14 Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out\\nmy soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart,\\nwhich is because of your iniquities!\\n\\nHelaman 7:15\\n 15 And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered\\nyourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need\\nto marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that\\nthe devil has got so great hold upon your hearts.\\n\\nHelaman 7:16\\n 16 Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who\\nis seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and\\nendless wo?\\n\\nHelaman 7:17\\n 17 O repent ye, repent ye! Why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye\\nunto the Lord your God. Why has he forsaken you?\\n\\nHelaman 7:18\\n 18 It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not\\nhearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have\\nprovoked him to anger against you.\\n\\nHelaman 7:19\\n 19 And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent,\\nbehold, he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for\\ndogs and wild beasts.\\n\\nHelaman 7:20\\n 20 O, how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that\\nhe has delivered you?\\n\\nHelaman 7:21\\n 21 But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and\\nthat ye might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts\\nupon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which\\nye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness\\nagainst your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.\\n\\nHelaman 7:22\\n 22 And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall\\nrepent. For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and\\nalso all those great cities which are round about, which are in\\nthe land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall\\nhave no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto\\nyou strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your\\nenemies.\\n\\nHelaman 7:23\\n 23 For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the\\nwicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be\\nunto those that repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words.\\nNow therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that\\nit shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall\\nrepent.\\n\\nHelaman 7:24\\n 24 For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have\\nnot sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received;\\ntherefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will\\nlengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou\\nshalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.\\n\\nHelaman 7:25\\n 25 Yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which\\nhas come among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea,\\nto that secret band which was established by Gadianton!\\n\\nHelaman 7:26\\n 26 Yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye\\nhave suffered to enter your hearts, which has lifted you up\\nbeyond that which is good because of your exceedingly great\\nriches!\\n\\nHelaman 7:27\\n 27 Yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and\\nabominations!\\n\\nHelaman 7:28\\n 28 And except ye repent ye shall perish; yea, even your lands\\nshall be taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the\\nface of the earth.\\n\\nHelaman 7:29\\n 29 Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of\\nmyself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but\\nbehold, I know that these things are true because the Lord God\\nhas made them known unto me, therefore I testify that they shall\\nbe.\\n\\nHelaman 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\nHelaman 8:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words,\\nbehold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the\\nsecret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out\\nagainst him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon\\nthis man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according\\nto the crime which he has done?\\n\\nHelaman 8:2\\n 2 Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this\\npeople and against our law?\\n\\nHelaman 8:3\\n 3 For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the\\ncorruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which\\ncannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to\\nthe commandments of God.\\n\\nHelaman 8:4\\n 4 And those judges were angry with him because he spake plainly\\nunto them concerning their secret works of darkness;\\nnevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for\\nthey feared the people lest they should cry out against them.\\n\\nHelaman 8:5\\n 5 Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you\\nsuffer this man to revile against us?  For behold he doth condemn\\nall this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these\\nour great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no\\nplace in them.\\n\\nHelaman 8:6\\n 6 And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are\\npowerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no\\npower over us.\\n\\nHelaman 8:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to\\nanger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there\\nwere some who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good\\nman, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass\\nexcept we repent;\\n\\nHelaman 8:8\\n 8 Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has\\ntestified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto\\nus concerning our iniquities.  And behold they are many, and he\\nknoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of\\nour iniquities;\\n\\nHelaman 8:9\\n 9 Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not\\nhave testified concerning those things.\\n\\nHelaman 8:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy\\nNephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay\\ntheir hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them,\\nseeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch\\nthat the remainder of them did fear.\\n\\nHelaman 8:11\\n 11 Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying:\\nBehold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto\\none man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and\\nthey parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who\\nwere our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters\\nclosed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up?\\n\\nHelaman 8:12\\n 12 And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then\\nwhy should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath\\ngiven unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the\\njudgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?\\n\\nHelaman 8:13\\n 13 But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all\\nthe words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the\\nwords which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great\\npower given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken\\nconcerning the coming of the Messiah.\\n\\nHelaman 8:14\\n 14 Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come? \\nAnd as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so\\nshall he be lifted up who should come.\\n\\nHelaman 8:15\\n 15 And as many as should look upon that serpent should live,\\neven so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith,\\nhaving a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which\\nis eternal.\\n\\nHelaman 8:16\\n 16 And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things,\\nbut also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of\\nAbraham.\\n\\nHelaman 8:17\\n 17 Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled\\nwith gladness and did rejoice.\\n\\nHelaman 8:18\\n 18 Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of\\nthese things, but there were many before the days of Abraham who\\nwere called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his\\nSon; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great\\nmany thousand years before his coming, that even redemption\\nshould come unto them.\\n\\nHelaman 8:19\\n 19 And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days\\nof Abraham there have been many prophets that have testified\\nthese things; yea, behold, the prophet Zenos did testify boldly;\\nfor the which he was slain.\\n\\nHelaman 8:20\\n 20 And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and\\nJeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the\\ndestruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was\\ndestroyed according to the words of Jeremiah.  O then why not the\\nSon of God come, according to his prophecy?\\n\\nHelaman 8:21\\n 21 And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed?  Will\\nye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it\\nwere Mulek?  Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah\\nare with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? \\nBut behold, this is not all--\\n\\nHelaman 8:22\\n 22 Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he\\ntestified of these things.  Nephi also testified of these things,\\nand also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea,\\nthey have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked\\nforward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.\\n\\nHelaman 8:23\\n 23 And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did\\nmanifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and\\nthey gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come.\\n\\nHelaman 8:24\\n 24 And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them\\nexcept ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye\\nhave rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many evidences\\nwhich ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things,\\nboth things in heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as\\na witness that they are true.\\n\\nHelaman 8:25\\n 25 But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against\\nyour holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for\\nyourselves treasures in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and\\nwhere nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for\\nyourselves wrath against the day of judgment.\\n\\nHelaman 8:26\\n 26 Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your\\nmurders and your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting\\ndestruction; yea, and except ye repent it will come unto you\\nsoon.\\n\\nHelaman 8:27\\n 27 Yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto\\nthe judgment-seat, and search; and behold, your judge is\\nmurdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by\\nhis brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.\\n\\nHelaman 8:28\\n 28 And behold, they both belong to your secret band, whose\\nauthor is Gadianton and the evil one who seeketh to destroy the\\nsouls of men.\\n\\nHelaman 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\nHelaman 9:1\\n 1 Behold, now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these\\nwords, certain men who were among them ran to the judgment-seat;\\nyea, even there were five who went, and they said among\\nthemselves, as they went:\\n\\nHelaman 9:2\\n 2 Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a\\nprophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous\\nthings unto us.  Behold, we do not believe that he hath; yea, we\\ndo not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing\\nwhich he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be\\ndead, then will we believe that the other words which he has\\nspoken are true.\\n\\nHelaman 9:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in\\nunto the judgment-seat; and behold, the chief judge had fallen to\\nthe earth, and did lie in his blood.\\n\\nHelaman 9:4\\n 4 And now behold, when they saw this they were astonished\\nexceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had\\nnot believed the words which Nephi had spoken concerning the\\nchief judge.\\n\\nHelaman 9:5\\n 5 But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them\\nlest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken should come upon\\nthe people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the\\nearth.\\n\\nHelaman 9:6\\n 6 Now, immediately when the judge had been murdered--he being\\nstabbed by his brother by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the\\nservants ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among\\nthem;\\n\\nHelaman 9:7\\n 7 And behold the people did gather themselves together unto the\\nplace of the judgment-seat--and behold, to their astonishment\\nthey saw those five men who had fallen to the earth.\\n\\nHelaman 9:8\\n 8 And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the\\nmultitude who had gathered together at the garden of Nephi;\\ntherefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have\\nmurdered the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not\\nflee from us.\\n\\nHelaman 9:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound\\nthem and cast them into prison.  And there was a proclamation\\nsent abroad that the judge was slain, and that the murderers had\\nbeen taken and were cast into prison.\\n\\nHelaman 9:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that on the morrow the people did\\nassemble themselves together to mourn and to fast, at the burial\\nof the great chief judge who had been slain.\\n\\nHelaman 9:11\\n 11 And thus also those judges who were at the garden of Nephi,\\nand heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.\\n\\nHelaman 9:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that they inquired among the people,\\nsaying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning\\nthe chief judge whether he was dead?  And they answered and said:\\nConcerning this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but\\nthere are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into\\nprison.\\n\\nHelaman 9:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that the judges desired that they should\\nbe brought; and they were brought, and behold they were the five\\nwho were sent; and behold the judges inquired of them to know,\\nconcerning the matter, and they told them all that they had done,\\nsaying:\\n\\nHelaman 9:14\\n 14 We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when\\nwe saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished\\ninsomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered\\nfrom our astonishment, behold they cast us into prison.\\n\\nHelaman 9:15\\n 15 Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not who has done\\nit; and only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye\\ndesired, and behold he was dead, according to the words of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 9:16\\n 16 And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the\\nmatter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying:\\nBehold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to\\nslay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he\\nmight convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to\\nbe a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.\\n\\nHelaman 9:17\\n 17 And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess\\nhis fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.\\n\\nHelaman 9:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day\\nof the burial.  Nevertheless, they did rebuke the judges in the\\nwords which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with\\nthem one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.\\n\\nHelaman 9:19\\n 19 Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and\\nbound and brought before the multitude, and they began to\\nquestion him in divers ways that they might cross him, that they\\nmight accuse him to death--\\n\\nHelaman 9:20\\n 20 Saying unto him: Thou art confederate; who is this man that\\nhath done this murder?  Now tell us, and acknowledge thy fault;\\nsaying, Behold here is money; and also we will grant unto thee\\nthy life if thou wilt tell us, and acknowledge the agreement\\nwhich thou hast made with him.\\n\\nHelaman 9:21\\n 21 But Nephi said unto them: O ye fools, ye uncircumcised of\\nheart, ye blind, and ye stiffnecked people, do ye know how long\\nthe Lord your God will suffer you that ye shall go on in this\\nyour way of sin?\\n\\nHelaman 9:22\\n 22 O ye ought to begin to howl and mourn, because of the great\\ndestruction which at this time doth await you, except ye shall\\nrepent.\\n\\nHelaman 9:23\\n 23 Behold ye say that I have agreed with a man that he should\\nmurder Seezoram, our chief judge.  But behold, I say unto you,\\nthat this is because I have testified unto you that ye might know\\nconcerning this thing; yea, even for a witness unto you, that I\\ndid know of the wickedness and abominations which are among you.\\n\\nHelaman 9:24\\n 24 And because I have done this, ye say that I have agreed with\\na man that he should do this thing; yea, because I showed unto\\nyou this sign ye are angry with me, and seek to destroy my life.\\n\\nHelaman 9:25\\n 25 And now behold, I will show unto you another sign, and see if\\nye will in this thing seek to destroy me.\\n\\nHelaman 9:26\\n 26 Behold I say unto you: Go to the house of Seantum, who is the\\nbrother of Seezoram, and say unto him--\\n\\nHelaman 9:27\\n 27 Has Nephi, the pretended prophet, who doth prophesy so much\\nevil concerning this people, agreed with thee, in the which ye\\nhave murdered Seezoram, who is your brother?\\n\\nHelaman 9:28\\n 28 And behold, he shall say unto you, Nay.\\n\\nHelaman 9:29\\n 29 And ye shall say unto him: Have ye murdered your brother?\\n\\nHelaman 9:30\\n 30 And he shall stand with fear, and wist not what to say.  And\\nbehold, he shall deny unto you; and he shall make as if he were\\nastonished; nevertheless, he shall declare unto you that he is\\ninnocent.\\n\\nHelaman 9:31\\n 31 But behold, ye shall examine him, and ye shall find blood\\nupon the skirts of his cloak.\\n\\nHelaman 9:32\\n 32 And when ye have seen this, ye shall say: From whence cometh\\nthis blood?  Do we not know that it is the blood of your brother?\\n\\nHelaman 9:33\\n 33 And then shall he tremble, and shall look pale, even as if\\ndeath had come upon him.\\n\\nHelaman 9:34\\n 34 And then shall ye say: Because of this fear and this paleness\\nwhich has come upon your face, behold, we know that thou art\\nguilty.\\n\\nHelaman 9:35\\n 35 And then shall greater fear come upon him; and then shall he\\nconfess unto you, and deny no more that he has done this murder.\\n\\nHelaman 9:36\\n 36 And then shall he say unto you, that I, Nephi, know nothing\\nconcerning the matter save it were given unto me by the power of\\nGod.  And then shall ye know that I am an honest man, and that I\\nam sent unto you from God.\\n\\nHelaman 9:37\\n 37 And it came to pass that they went and did, even according as\\nNephi had said unto them.  And behold, the words which he had\\nsaid were true; for according to the words he did deny; and also\\naccording to the words he did confess.\\n\\nHelaman 9:38\\n 38 And he was brought to prove that he himself was the very\\nmurderer, insomuch that the five were set at liberty, and also\\nwas Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 9:39\\n 39 And there were some of the Nephites who believed on the words\\nof Nephi; and there were some also, who believed because of the\\ntestimony of the five, for they had been converted while they\\nwere in prison.\\n\\nHelaman 9:40\\n 40 And now there were some among the people, who said that Nephi\\nwas a prophet.\\n\\nHelaman 9:41\\n 41 And there were others who said: Behold, he is a god, for\\nexcept he was a god he could not know of all things.  For behold,\\nhe has told us the thoughts of our hearts, and also has told us\\nthings; and even he has brought unto our knowledge the true\\nmurderer of our chief judge.\\n\\nHelaman 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\nHelaman 10:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that there arose a division among the\\npeople, insomuch that they divided hither and thither and went\\ntheir ways, leaving Nephi alone, as he was standing in the midst\\nof them.\\n\\nHelaman 10:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that Nephi went his way towards his own\\nhouse, pondering upon the things which the Lord had shown unto\\nhim.\\n\\nHelaman 10:3\\n 3 And it came to pass as he was thus pondering--being much cast\\ndown because of the wickedness of the people of the Nephites,\\ntheir secret works of darkness, and their murderings, and their\\nplunderings, and all manner of iniquities--and it came to pass as\\nhe was thus pondering in his heart, behold, a voice came unto him\\nsaying:\\n\\nHelaman 10:4\\n 4 Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast\\ndone; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness\\ndeclared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this\\npeople.  And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine\\nown life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.\\nHelaman 10:5\\n 5 And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness,\\nbehold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in\\nword and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all\\nthings shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou\\nshalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.\\n\\nHelaman 10:6\\n 6 Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God.  Behold, I declare it\\nunto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have\\npower over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine,\\nand with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness\\nof this people.\\n\\nHelaman 10:7\\n 7 Behold, I give unto you power, that whatsoever ye shall seal\\non earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose\\non earth shall be loosed in heaven; and thus shall ye have power\\namong this people.\\n\\nHelaman 10:8\\n 8 And thus, if ye shall say unto this temple it shall be rent in\\ntwain, it shall be done.\\n\\nHelaman 10:9\\n 9 And if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou cast down and\\nbecome smooth, it shall be done.\\n\\nHelaman 10:10\\n 10 And behold, if ye shall say that God shall smite this people,\\nit shall come to pass.\\n\\nHelaman 10:11\\n 11 And now behold, I command you, that ye shall go and declare\\nunto this people, that thus saith the Lord God, who is the\\nAlmighty: Except ye repent ye shall be smitten, even unto\\ndestruction.\\n\\nHelaman 10:12\\n 12 And behold, now it came to pass that when the Lord had spoken\\nthese words unto Nephi, he did stop and did not go unto his own\\nhouse, but did return unto the multitudes who were scattered\\nabout upon the face of the land, and began to declare unto them\\nthe word of the Lord which had been spoken unto him, concerning\\ntheir destruction if they did not repent.\\n\\nHelaman 10:13\\n 13 Now behold, notwithstanding that great miracle which Nephi\\nhad done in telling them concerning the death of the chief judge,\\nthey did harden their hearts and did not hearken unto the words\\nof the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 10:14\\n 14 Therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word of the Lord,\\nsaying: Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord, ye shall be\\nsmitten even unto destruction.\\n\\nHelaman 10:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them\\nthe word, behold, they did still harden their hearts and would\\nnot hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against\\nhim, and did seek to lay their hands upon him that they might\\ncast him into prison.\\n\\nHelaman 10:16\\n 16 But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not\\ntake him to cast him into prison, for he was taken by the Spirit\\nand conveyed away out of the midst of them.\\n\\nHelaman 10:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit,\\nfrom multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even\\nuntil he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among\\nall the people.\\n\\nHelaman 10:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his\\nwords; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were\\ndivided against themselves and began to slay one another with the\\nsword.\\n\\nHelaman 10:19\\n 19 And thus ended the seventy and first year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 11\\nChapter 11\\n\\nHelaman 11:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass in the seventy and second year of the\\nreign of the judges that the contentions did increase, insomuch\\nthat there were wars throughout all the land among all the people\\nof Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 11:2\\n 2 And it was this secret band of robbers who did carry on this\\nwork of destruction and wickedness.  And this war did last all\\nthat year; and in the seventy and third year it did also last.\\n\\nHelaman 11:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the\\nLord, saying:\\n\\nHelaman 11:4\\n 4 O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by\\nthe sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land,\\nto stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps\\nthey will repent and turn unto thee.\\n\\nHelaman 11:5\\n 5 And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi.  And\\nthere was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of\\nNephi.  And thus in the seventy and fourth year the famine did\\ncontinue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but\\nbecame sore by famine.\\n\\nHelaman 11:6\\n 6 And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy\\nand fifth year.  For the earth was smitten that it was dry, and\\ndid not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole\\nearth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the\\nNephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by\\nthousands in the more wicked parts of the land.\\n\\nHelaman 11:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about\\nto perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their\\nGod; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 11:8\\n 8 And the people began to plead with their chief judges and\\ntheir leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know\\nthat thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our\\nGod that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words\\nwhich thou hast spoken concerning our destruction be fulfilled.\\n\\nHelaman 11:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi,\\naccording to the words which had been desired.  And it came to\\npass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented and did\\nhumble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord,\\nsaying:\\n\\nHelaman 11:10\\n 10 O Lord, behold this people repenteth; and they have swept\\naway the band of Gadianton from amongst them insomuch that they\\nhave become extinct, and they have concealed their secret plans\\nin the earth.\\n\\nHelaman 11:11\\n 11 Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn\\naway thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the\\ndestruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.\\n\\nHelaman 11:12\\n 12 O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce\\nanger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land.\\n\\nHelaman 11:13\\n 13 O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be\\ndone according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of\\nthe earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in\\nthe season of grain.\\n\\nHelaman 11:14\\n 14 O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let\\nthere be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease;\\nand I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my\\nwords, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare\\nthem.\\n\\nHelaman 11:15\\n 15 Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because\\nof the famine and the pestilence and destruction which has come\\nunto them.\\n\\nHelaman 11:16\\n 16 And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try\\nagain if they will serve thee?  And if so, O Lord, thou canst\\nbless them according to thy words which thou hast said.\\n\\nHelaman 11:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that in the seventy and sixth year the\\nLord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that\\nrain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth\\nher fruit in the season of her fruit.  And it came to pass that\\nit did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.\\n\\nHelaman 11:18\\n 18 And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the\\nwhole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no\\nmore seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great\\nprophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given\\nunto him from God.\\n\\nHelaman 11:19\\n 19 And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as\\nto things pertaining to righteousness.\\n\\nHelaman 11:20\\n 20 And thus it did come to pass that the people of Nephi began\\nto prosper again in the land, and began to build up their waste\\nplaces, and began to multiply and spread, even until they did\\ncover the whole face of the land, both on the northward and on\\nthe southward, from the sea west to the sea east.\\n\\nHelaman 11:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the seventy and sixth year did end\\nin peace.  And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and\\nthe church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and\\nthe more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites,\\ndid belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great\\npeace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.\\n\\nHelaman 11:22\\n 22 And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save\\nit were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which\\nhad been laid down by the prophets.\\n\\nHelaman 11:23\\n 23 And in the seventy and ninth year there began to be much\\nstrife.  But it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi, and many of\\ntheir brethren who knew concerning the true points of doctrine,\\nhaving many revelations daily, therefore they did preach unto the\\npeople, insomuch that they did put an end to their strife in that\\nsame year.\\n\\nHelaman 11:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that in the eightieth year of the reign\\nof the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain\\nnumber of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some\\nyears before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon\\nthemselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who\\nwere real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger\\nby them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war\\nwith their brethren.\\n\\nHelaman 11:25\\n 25 And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would\\nretreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and\\nsecret places, hiding themselves that they could not be\\ndiscovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers,\\ninasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.\\n\\nHelaman 11:26\\n 26 And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years,\\nthey became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did\\nsearch out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they\\nbecame robbers of Gadianton.\\n\\nHelaman 11:27\\n 27 Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even\\ngreat destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the\\npeople of the Lamanites.\\n\\nHelaman 11:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should\\nbe a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an\\narmy of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to\\nsearch out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.\\n\\nHelaman 11:29\\n 29 But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were\\ndriven back even into their own lands.  And thus ended the\\neightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of\\nNephi.\\n\\nHelaman 11:30\\n 30 And it came to pass in the commencement of the eighty and\\nfirst year they did go forth again against this band of robbers,\\nand did destroy many; and they were also visited with much\\ndestruction.\\n\\nHelaman 11:31\\n 31 And they were again obliged to return out of the wilderness\\nand out of the mountains unto their own lands, because of the\\nexceeding greatness of the numbers of those robbers who infested\\nthe mountains and the wilderness.\\n\\nHelaman 11:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that thus ended this year.  And the\\nrobbers did still increase and wax strong, insomuch that they did\\ndefy the whole armies of the Nephites, and also of the Lamanites;\\nand they did cause great fear to come unto the people upon all\\nthe face of the land.\\n\\nHelaman 11:33\\n 33 Yea, for they did visit many parts of the land, and did do\\ngreat destruction unto them; yea, did kill many, and did carry\\naway others captive into the wilderness, yea, and more especially\\ntheir women and their children.\\n\\nHelaman 11:34\\n 34 Now this great evil, which came unto the people because of\\ntheir iniquity, did stir them up again in remembrance of the Lord\\ntheir God.\\n\\nHelaman 11:35\\n 35 And thus ended the eighty and first year of the reign of the\\njudges.\\n\\nHelaman 11:36\\n 36 And in the eighty and second year they began again to forget\\nthe Lord their God.  And in the eighty and third year they began\\nto wax strong in iniquity.  And in the eighty and fourth year\\nthey did not mend their ways.\\n\\nHelaman 11:37\\n 37 And it came to pass in the eighty and fifth year they did wax\\nstronger and stronger in their pride, and in their wickedness;\\nand thus they were ripening again for destruction.\\n\\nHelaman 11:38\\n 38 And thus ended the eighty and fifth year.\\n\\nHelaman 12\\nChapter 12\\n\\nHelaman 12:1\\n 1 And thus we can behold how false, and also the unsteadiness of\\nthe hearts of the children of men; yea, we can see that the Lord\\nin his great infinite goodness doth bless and prosper those who\\nput their trust in him.\\n\\nHelaman 12:2\\n 2 Yea, and we may see at the very time when he doth prosper his\\npeople, yea, in the increase of their fields, their flocks and\\ntheir herds, and in gold, and in silver, and in all manner of\\nprecious things of every kind and art; sparing their lives, and\\ndelivering them out of the hands of their enemies; softening the\\nhearts of their enemies that they should not declare wars against\\nthem; yea, and in fine, doing all things for the welfare and\\nhappiness of his people; yea, then is the time that they do\\nharden their hearts, and do forget the Lord their God, and do\\ntrample under their feet the Holy One--yea, and this because of\\ntheir ease, and their exceedingly great prosperity.\\n\\nHelaman 12:3\\n 3 And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people\\nwith many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death\\nand with terror, and with famine and with all manner of\\npestilence, they will not remember him.\\n\\nHelaman 12:4\\n 4 O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and\\nhow quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the\\nchildren of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the\\nevil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the\\nworld!\\n\\nHelaman 12:5\\n 5 Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to\\nboast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow\\nare they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his\\ncounsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's paths!\\n\\nHelaman 12:6\\n 6 Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath\\ncreated them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding\\nhis great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at\\nnaught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their\\nguide.\\n\\nHelaman 12:7\\n 7 O how great is the nothingness of the children of men; yea,\\neven they are less than the dust of the earth.\\n\\nHelaman 12:8\\n 8 For behold, the dust of the earth moveth hither and thither,\\nto the dividing asunder, at the command of our great and\\neverlasting God.\\n\\nHelaman 12:9\\n 9 Yea, behold at his voice do the hills and the mountains\\ntremble and quake.\\n\\nHelaman 12:10\\n 10 And by the power of his voice they are broken up, and become\\nsmooth, yea, even like unto a valley.\\n\\nHelaman 12:11\\n 11 Yea, by the power of his voice doth the whole earth shake;\\n\\nHelaman 12:12\\n 12 Yea, by the power of his voice, do the foundations rock, even\\nto the very center.\\n\\nHelaman 12:13\\n 13 Yea, and if he say unto the earth--Move--it is moved.\\n\\nHelaman 12:14\\n 14 Yea, if he say unto the earth--Thou shalt go back, that it\\nlengthen out the day for many hours--it is done;\\n\\nHelaman 12:15\\n 15 And thus, according to his word the earth goeth back, and it\\nappeareth unto man that the sun standeth still; yea, and behold,\\nthis is so; for surely it is the earth that moveth and not the\\nsun.\\n\\nHelaman 12:16\\n 16 And behold, also, if he say unto the waters of the great\\ndeep--Be thou dried up--it is done.\\n\\nHelaman 12:17\\n 17 Behold, if he say unto this mountain--Be thou raised up, and\\ncome over and fall upon that city, that it be buried up--behold\\nit is done.\\n\\nHelaman 12:18\\n 18 And behold, if a man hide up a treasure in the earth, and the\\nLord shall say--Let it be accursed, because of the iniquity of\\nhim who hath hid it up--behold, it shall be accursed.\\n\\nHelaman 12:19\\n 19 And if the Lord shall say--Be thou accursed, that no man\\nshall find thee from this time henceforth and forever--behold, no\\nman getteth it henceforth and forever.\\n\\nHelaman 12:20\\n 20 And behold, if the Lord shall say unto a man--Because of\\nthine iniquities, thou shalt be accursed forever--it shall be\\ndone.\\n\\nHelaman 12:21\\n 21 And if the Lord shall say--Because of thine iniquities thou\\nshalt be cut off from my presence--he will cause that it shall be\\nso.\\n\\nHelaman 12:22\\n 22 And wo unto him to whom he shall say this, for it shall be\\nunto him that will do iniquity, and he cannot be saved;\\ntherefore, for this cause, that men might be saved, hath\\nrepentance been declared.\\n\\nHelaman 12:23\\n 23 Therefore, blessed are they who will repent and hearken unto\\nthe voice of the Lord their God; for these are they that shall be\\nsaved.\\n\\nHelaman 12:24\\n 24 And may God grant, in his great fulness, that men might be\\nbrought unto repentance and good works, that they might be\\nrestored unto grace for grace, according to their works.\\n\\nHelaman 12:25\\n 25 And I would that all men might be saved.  But we read that in\\nthe great and last day there are some who shall be cast out, yea,\\nwho shall be cast off from the presence of the Lord;\\n\\nHelaman 12:26\\n 26 Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of endless misery,\\nfulfilling the words which say: They that have done good shall\\nhave everlasting life; and they that have done evil shall have\\neverlasting damnation.  And thus it is.  Amen.\\n\\nHelaman 13\\nChapter 13\\n\\nHelaman 13:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass in the eighty and sixth year, the\\nNephites did still remain in wickedness, yea in great wickedness,\\nwhile the Lamanites did observe strictly to keep the commandments\\nof God, according to the law of Moses.\\n\\nHelaman 13:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that in this year there was one Samuel, a\\nLamanite, came into the land of Zarahemla, and began to preach\\nunto the people.  And it came to pass that he did preach, many\\ndays, repentance unto the people, and they did cast him out, and\\nhe was about to return to his own land.\\n\\nHelaman 13:3\\n 3 But behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, that he\\nshould return again, and prophesy unto the people whatsoever\\nthings should come into his heart.\\n\\nHelaman 13:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that they would not suffer that he should\\nenter into the city; therefore he went and got upon the wall\\nthereof, and stretched forth his hand and cried with a loud\\nvoice, and prophesied unto the people whatsoever things the Lord\\nput into his heart.\\n\\nHelaman 13:5\\n 5 And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak\\nthe words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold\\nhe hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the\\nsword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years\\npass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.\\n\\nHelaman 13:6\\n 6 Yea, heavy destruction awaiteth this people, and it surely\\ncometh unto this people, and nothing can save this people save it\\nbe repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, who surely\\nshall come into the world, and shall suffer many things and shall\\nbe slain for his people.\\n\\nHelaman 13:7\\n 7 And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and\\nhe did bring glad tidings to my soul.  And behold, I was sent\\nunto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad\\ntidings; but behold ye would not receive me.\\n\\nHelaman 13:8\\n 8 Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the\\nhearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will\\ntake away my word from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from\\nthem, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the\\nhearts of their brethren against them.\\n\\nHelaman 13:9\\n 9 And four hundred years shall not pass away before I will cause\\nthat they shall be smitten; yea, I will visit them with the sword\\nand with famine and with pestilence.\\n\\nHelaman 13:10\\n 10 Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be\\nthose of the fourth generation who shall live, of your enemies,\\nto behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come\\nexcept ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth\\ngeneration shall visit your destruction.\\n\\nHelaman 13:11\\n 11 But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God I\\nwill turn away mine anger, saith the Lord; yea, thus saith the\\nLord, blessed are they who will repent and turn unto me, but wo\\nunto him that repenteth not.\\n\\nHelaman 13:12\\n 12 Yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for behold, it is\\nbecause of those who are righteous that it is saved; yea, wo unto\\nthis great city, for I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are\\nmany, yea, even the more part of this great city, that will\\nharden their hearts against me, saith the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 13:13\\n 13 But blessed are they who will repent, for them will I spare. \\nBut behold, if it were not for the righteous who are in this\\ngreat city, behold, I would cause that fire should come down out\\nof heaven and destroy it.\\n\\nHelaman 13:14\\n 14 But behold, it is for the righteous' sake that it is spared. \\nBut behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall\\ncast out the righteous from among you, then shall ye be ripe for\\ndestruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the\\nwickedness and abominations which are in her.\\n\\nHelaman 13:15\\n 15 Yea, and wo be unto the city of Gideon, for the wickedness\\nand abominations which are in her.\\n\\nHelaman 13:16\\n 16 Yea, and wo be unto all the cities which are in the land\\nround about, which are possessed by the Nephites, because of the\\nwickedness and abominations which are in them.\\n\\nHelaman 13:17\\n 17 And behold, a curse shall come upon the land, saith the Lord\\nof Hosts, because of the people's sake who are upon the land,\\nyea, because of their wickedness and their abominations.\\n\\nHelaman 13:18\\n 18 And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our\\ngreat and true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the\\nearth shall find them again no more, because of the great curse\\nof the land, save he be a righteous man and shall hide it up unto\\nthe Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 13:19\\n 19 For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their\\ntreasures unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up their\\ntreasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me\\nsave it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures\\nunto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall\\nredeem it because of the curse of the land.\\n\\nHelaman 13:20\\n 20 And the day shall come that they shall hide up their\\ntreasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and\\nbecause they have set their hearts upon their riches, and will\\nhide up their treasures when they shall flee before their\\nenemies; because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed be\\nthey and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be\\nsmitten, saith the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 13:21\\n 21 Behold ye, the people of this great city, and hearken unto my\\nwords; yea, hearken unto the words which the Lord saith; for\\nbehold, he saith that ye are cursed because of your riches, and\\nalso are your riches cursed because ye have set your hearts upon\\nthem, and have not hearkened unto the words of him who gave them\\nunto you.\\n\\nHelaman 13:22\\n 22 Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which\\nhe hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches, not\\nto thank the Lord your God for them; yea, your hearts are not\\ndrawn out unto the Lord, but they do swell with great pride, unto\\nboasting, and unto great swelling, envyings, strifes, malice,\\npersecutions and murders, and all manner of iniquities.\\n\\nHelaman 13:23\\n 23 For this cause hath the Lord God caused that a curse should\\ncome upon the land, and also upon your riches, and this because\\nof your iniquities.\\n\\nHelaman 13:24\\n 24 Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has\\narrived, that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and\\ncast stones at them, and do slay them, and do all manner of\\niniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.\\n\\nHelaman 13:25\\n 25 And now when ye talk, ye say: If our days had been in the\\ndays of our fathers of old, we would not have slain the prophets;\\nwe would not have stoned them, and cast them out.\\n\\nHelaman 13:26\\n 26 Behold ye are worse than they; for as the Lord liveth, if a\\nprophet come among you and declareth unto you the word of the\\nLord, which testifieth of your sins and iniquities, ye are angry\\nwith him, and cast him out and seek all manner of ways to destroy\\nhim; yea, you will say that he is a false prophet, and that he is\\na sinner, and of the devil, because he testifieth that your deeds\\nare evil.\\n\\nHelaman 13:27\\n 27 But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do\\nthis, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer;\\nyea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea,\\nwalk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart\\ndesireth--and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will\\nreceive him, and say that he is a prophet.\\n\\nHelaman 13:28\\n 28 Yea, ye will lift him up, and ye will give unto him of your\\nsubstance; ye will give unto him of your gold, and of your\\nsilver, and ye will clothe him with costly apparel; and because\\nhe speaketh flattering words unto you, and he saith that all is\\nwell, then ye will not find fault with him.\\n\\nHelaman 13:29\\n 29 O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye\\nstiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will\\nsuffer you?  Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by\\nfoolish and blind guides?  Yea, how long will ye choose darkness\\nrather than light?\\n\\nHelaman 13:30\\n 30 Yea, behold, the anger of the Lord is already kindled against\\nyou; behold, he hath cursed the land because of your iniquity.\\n\\nHelaman 13:31\\n 31 And behold, the time cometh that he curseth your riches, that\\nthey become slippery, that ye cannot hold them; and in the days\\nof your poverty ye cannot retain them.\\n\\nHelaman 13:32\\n 32 And in the days of your poverty ye shall cry unto the Lord;\\nand in vain shall ye cry, for your desolation is already come\\nupon you, and your destruction is made sure; and then shall ye\\nweep and howl in that day, saith the Lord of Hosts.  And then\\nshall ye lament, and say:\\n\\nHelaman 13:33\\n 33 O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and\\nstoned them, and cast them out.  Yea, in that day ye shall say: O\\nthat we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave\\nus our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that\\nwe should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.\\n\\nHelaman 13:34\\n 34 Behold, we lay a tool here and on the morrow it is gone; and\\nbehold, our swords are taken from us in the day we have sought\\nthem for battle.\\n\\nHelaman 13:35\\n 35 Yea, we have hid up our treasures and they have slipped away\\nfrom us, because of the curse of the land.\\n\\nHelaman 13:36\\n 36 O that we had repented in the day that the word of the Lord\\ncame unto us; for behold the land is cursed, and all things are\\nbecome slippery, and we cannot hold them.\\n\\nHelaman 13:37\\n 37 Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled\\nabout by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. \\nBehold, our iniquities are great.  O Lord, canst thou not turn\\naway thine anger from us?  And this shall be your language in\\nthose days.\\n\\nHelaman 13:38\\n 38 But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have\\nprocrastinated the day of your salvation until it is\\neverlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea,\\nfor ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye\\ncould not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing\\niniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that\\nrighteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.\\n\\nHelaman 13:39\\n 39 O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words!  And I\\npray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that\\nye would repent and be saved.\\n\\nHelaman 14\\nChapter 14\\n\\nHelaman 14:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did\\nprophesy a great many more things which cannot be written.\\n\\nHelaman 14:2\\n 2 And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give unto you a sign;\\nfor five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of\\nGod to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.\\n\\nHelaman 14:3\\n 3 And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time\\nof his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven,\\ninsomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no\\ndarkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was\\nday.\\n\\nHelaman 14:4\\n 4 Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if\\nit were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto\\nyou for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and\\nalso of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that\\nthere shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall\\nnot be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.\\n\\nHelaman 14:5\\n 5 And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye\\nnever have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.\\n\\nHelaman 14:6\\n 6 And behold this is not all, there shall be many signs and\\nwonders in heaven.\\n\\nHelaman 14:7\\n 7 And it shall come to pass that ye shall all be amazed, and\\nwonder, insomuch that ye shall fall to the earth.\\n\\nHelaman 14:8\\n 8 And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall believe on the\\nSon of God, the same shall have everlasting life.\\n\\nHelaman 14:9\\n 9 And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel,\\nthat I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath\\ncommanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he\\nhath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the\\nway of the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 14:10\\n 10 And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you\\nthe words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was\\nhard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me,\\nand have cast me out from among you.\\n\\nHelaman 14:11\\n 11 And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come\\nup upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of\\nthe judgments of God which do await you because of your\\niniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of\\nrepentance;\\n\\nHelaman 14:12\\n 12 And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ,\\nthe Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of\\nall things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the\\nsigns of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his\\nname.\\n\\nHelaman 14:13\\n 13 And if ye believe on his name ye will repent of all your\\nsins, that thereby ye may have a remission of them through his\\nmerits.\\n\\nHelaman 14:14\\n 14 And behold, again, another sign I give unto you, yea, a sign\\nof his death.\\n\\nHelaman 14:15\\n 15 For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea,\\nit behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring\\nto pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be\\nbrought into the presence of the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 14:16\\n 16 Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection,\\nand redeemeth all mankind from the first death--that spiritual\\ndeath; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from\\nthe presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to\\nthings temporal and to things spiritual.\\n\\nHelaman 14:17\\n 17 But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind,\\nyea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence\\nof the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 14:18\\n 18 Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance,\\nthat whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into\\nthe fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into\\nthe fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death,\\nyea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things\\npertaining to righteousness.\\n\\nHelaman 14:19\\n 19 Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things\\nand not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under\\ncondemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.\\n\\nHelaman 14:20\\n 20 But behold, as I said unto you concerning another sign, a\\nsign of his death, behold, in that day that he shall suffer death\\nthe sun shall be darkened and refuse to give his light unto you;\\nand also the moon and the stars; and there shall be no light upon\\nthe face of this land, even from the time that he shall suffer\\ndeath, for the space of three days, to the time that he shall\\nrise again from the dead.\\n\\nHelaman 14:21\\n 21 Yea, at the time that he shall yield up the ghost there shall\\nbe thunderings and lightnings for the space of many hours, and\\nthe earth shall shake and tremble; and the rocks which are upon\\nthe face of this earth, which are both above the earth and\\nbeneath, which ye know at this time are solid, or the more part\\nof it is one solid mass, shall be broken up;\\n\\nHelaman 14:22\\n 22 Yea, they shall be rent in twain, and shall ever after be\\nfound in seams and in cracks, and in broken fragments upon the\\nface of the whole earth, yea, both above the earth and beneath.\\n\\nHelaman 14:23\\n 23 And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be\\nmany mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be\\nmany places which are now called valleys which shall become\\nmountains, whose height is great.\\n\\nHelaman 14:24\\n 24 And many highways shall be broken up, and many cities shall\\nbecome desolate.\\n\\nHelaman 14:25\\n 25 And many graves shall be opened, and shall yield up many of\\ntheir dead; and many saints shall appear unto many.\\n\\nHelaman 14:26\\n 26 And behold, thus hath the angel spoken unto me; for he said\\nunto me that there should be thunderings and lightnings for the\\nspace of many hours.\\n\\nHelaman 14:27\\n 27 And he said unto me that while the thunder and the lightning\\nlasted, and the tempest, that these things should be, and that\\ndarkness should cover the face of the whole earth for the space\\nof three days.\\n\\nHelaman 14:28\\n 28 And the angel said unto me that many shall see greater things\\nthan these, to the intent that they might believe that these\\nsigns and these wonders should come to pass upon all the face of\\nthis land, to the intent that there should be no cause for\\nunbelief among the children of men--\\n\\nHelaman 14:29\\n 29 And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be\\nsaved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment\\nmight come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring\\nupon themselves their own condemnation.\\n\\nHelaman 14:30\\n 30 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever\\nperisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity,\\ndoeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted\\nto act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a\\nknowledge and he hath made you free.\\n\\nHelaman 14:31\\n 31 He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and\\nhe hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye\\ncan do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that\\nwhich is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that\\nwhich is evil restored unto you.\\n\\nHelaman 15\\nChapter 15\\n\\nHelaman 15:1\\n 1 And now, my beloved brethren, behold, I declare unto you that\\nexcept ye shall repent your houses shall be left unto you\\ndesolate.\\n\\nHelaman 15:2\\n 2 Yea, except ye repent, your women shall have great cause to\\nmourn in the day that they shall give suck; for ye shall attempt\\nto flee and there shall be no place for refuge; yea, and wo unto\\nthem which are with child, for they shall be heavy and cannot\\nflee; therefore, they shall be trodden down and shall be left to\\nperish.\\n\\nHelaman 15:3\\n 3 Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi\\nexcept they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and\\nwonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have\\nbeen a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath\\nhe loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of\\ntheir iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.\\n\\nHelaman 15:4\\n 4 But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because\\ntheir deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the\\niniquity of the tradition of their fathers.  But behold,\\nsalvation hath come unto them through the preaching of the\\nNephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.\\n\\nHelaman 15:5\\n 5 And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them\\nare in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly\\nbefore God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his\\nstatutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses.\\n\\nHelaman 15:6\\n 6 Yea, I say unto you, that the more part of them are doing\\nthis, and they are striving with unwearied diligence that they\\nmay bring the remainder of their brethren to the knowledge of the\\ntruth; therefore there are many who do add to their numbers\\ndaily.\\n\\nHelaman 15:7\\n 7 And behold, ye do know of yourselves, for ye have witnessed\\nit, that as many of them as are brought to the knowledge of the\\ntruth, and to know of the wicked and abominable traditions of\\ntheir fathers, and are led to believe the holy scriptures, yea,\\nthe prophecies of the holy prophets, which are written, which\\nleadeth them to faith on the Lord, and unto repentance, which\\nfaith and repentance bringeth a change of heart unto them--\\n\\nHelaman 15:8\\n 8 Therefore, as many as have come to this, ye know of yourselves\\nare firm and steadfast in the faith, and in the thing wherewith\\nthey have been made free.\\n\\nHelaman 15:9\\n 9 And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war,\\nand they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin;\\nyea, ye can see that they fear to sin--for behold they will\\nsuffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their\\nenemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this\\nbecause of their faith in Christ.\\n\\nHelaman 15:10\\n 10 And now, because of their steadfastness when they do believe\\nin that thing which they do believe, for because of their\\nfirmness when they are once enlightened, behold, the Lord shall\\nbless them and prolong their days, notwithstanding their\\niniquity--\\n\\nHelaman 15:11\\n 11 Yea, even if they should dwindle in unbelief the Lord shall\\nprolong their days, until the time shall come which hath been\\nspoken of by our fathers, and also by the prophet Zenos, and many\\nother prophets, concerning the restoration of our brethren, the\\nLamanites, again to the knowledge of the truth--\\n\\nHelaman 15:12\\n 12 Yea, I say unto you, that in the latter times the promises of\\nthe Lord have been extended to our brethren, the Lamanites; and\\nnotwithstanding the many afflictions which they shall have, and\\nnotwithstanding they shall be driven to and fro upon the face of\\nthe earth, and be hunted, and shall be smitten and scattered\\nabroad, having no place for refuge, the Lord shall be merciful\\nunto them.\\n\\nHelaman 15:13\\n 13 And this is according to the prophecy, that they shall again\\nbe brought to the true knowledge, which is knowledge of their\\nRedeemer, and their great and true shepherd, and be numbered\\namong his sheep.\\n\\nHelaman 15:14\\n 14 Therefore I say unto you, it shall be better for them than\\nfor you except ye repent.\\n\\nHelaman 15:15\\n 15 For behold, had the mighty works been shown unto them which\\nhave been shown unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in\\nunbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see\\nof yourselves that they never would again have dwindled in\\nunbelief.\\n\\nHelaman 15:16\\n 16 Therefore, saith the Lord: I will not utterly destroy them,\\nbut I will cause that in the day of my wisdom they shall return\\nagain unto me, saith the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 15:17\\n 17 And now behold, saith the Lord, concerning the people of the\\nNephites: If they will not repent, and observe to do my will, I\\nwill utterly destroy them, saith the Lord, because of their\\nunbelief notwithstanding the many mighty works which I have done\\namong them; and as surely as the Lord liveth shall these things\\nbe, saith the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 16\\nChapter 16\\n\\nHelaman 16:1\\n 1 And now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the\\nwords of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of\\nthe city.  And as many as believed on his word went forth and\\nsought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they\\nconfessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they\\nmight be baptized unto the Lord.\\n\\nHelaman 16:2\\n 2 But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of\\nSamuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the\\nwall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall;\\nbut the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could\\nnot hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.\\n\\nHelaman 16:3\\n 3 Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many\\nmore who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away\\nunto Nephi to be baptized.\\n\\nHelaman 16:4\\n 4 For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and\\npreaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and\\nwonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know\\nthat the Christ must shortly come--\\n\\nHelaman 16:5\\n 5 Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they\\nmight know and remember at the time of their coming that they had\\nbeen made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they\\nmight believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of\\nSamuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came\\nrepenting and confessing their sins.\\n\\nHelaman 16:6\\n 6 But the more part of them did not believe in the words of\\nSamuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with\\ntheir stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains,\\nsaying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a\\ndevil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we\\ncannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him\\nand bind him, and away with him.\\n\\nHelaman 16:7\\n 7 And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he\\ndid cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their\\nlands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to\\nprophesy among his own people.\\n\\nHelaman 16:8\\n 8 And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and\\nthus were the affairs of the people.\\n\\nHelaman 16:9\\n 9 And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the\\njudges over the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 16:10\\n 10 And thus ended also the eighty and seventh year of the reign\\nof the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their\\npride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more\\ncircumspectly before God.\\n\\nHelaman 16:11\\n 11 And these were the conditions also, in the eighty and eighth\\nyear of the reign of the judges.\\n\\nHelaman 16:12\\n 12 And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the\\npeople, save it were the people began to be more hardened in\\niniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the\\ncommandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of\\nthe judges.\\n\\nHelaman 16:13\\n 13 But it came to pass in the ninetieth year of the reign of the\\njudges, there were great signs given unto the people, and\\nwonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.\\n\\nHelaman 16:14\\n 14 And angels did appear unto men, wise men, and did declare\\nunto them glad tidings of great joy; thus in this year the\\nscriptures began to be fulfilled.\\n\\nHelaman 16:15\\n 15 Nevertheless, the people began to harden their hearts, all\\nsave it were the most believing part of them, both of the\\nNephites and also of the Lamanites, and began to depend upon\\ntheir own strength and upon their own wisdom, saying:\\n\\nHelaman 16:16\\n 16 Some things they may have guessed right, among so many; but\\nbehold, we know that all these great and marvelous works cannot\\ncome to pass, of which has been spoken.\\n\\nHelaman 16:17\\n 17 And they began to reason and to contend among themselves,\\nsaying:\\n\\nHelaman 16:18\\n 18 That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall\\ncome; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and\\nof earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself\\nunto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?\\n\\nHelaman 16:19\\n 19 Yea, why will he not show himself in this land as well as in\\nthe land of Jerusalem?\\n\\nHelaman 16:20\\n 20 But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which\\nhas been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we\\nshould believe in some great and marvelous thing which should\\ncome to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far\\ndistant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in\\nignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are\\ntrue.\\n\\nHelaman 16:21\\n 21 And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the\\nevil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand,\\nwhich will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also\\nservants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word;\\nand thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield\\nourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.\\n\\nHelaman 16:22\\n 22 And many more things did the people imagine up in their\\nhearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much\\ndisturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually;\\nyea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all\\nthe face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the\\npeople against that which was good and against that which should\\ncome.\\n\\nHelaman 16:23\\n 23 And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were\\nwrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which\\nthey did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people\\nupon all the face of the land.\\n\\nHelaman 16:24\\n 24 And thus ended the ninetieth year of the reign of the judges\\nover the people of Nephi.\\n\\nHelaman 16:25\\n 25 And thus ended the book of Helaman, according to the record\\nof Helaman and his sons.\\n\\n3 Nephi\\nTHIRD NEPHI\\nTHE BOOK OF NEPHI\\nTHE SON OF NEPHI, WHO WAS THE SON OF HELAMAN\\nAnd Helaman was the son of Helaman, who was the son of Alma, who\\nwas the son of Alma, being a descendant of Nephi who was the son\\nof Lehi, who came out of Jerusalem in the first year of the reign\\nof Zedekiah, the king of Judah.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:1\\n 1 Now it came to pass that the ninety and first year had passed\\naway and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left\\nJerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief\\njudge and the governor over the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:2\\n 2 And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of\\nZarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest\\nson, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which\\nhad been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred\\nfrom the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:3\\n 3 Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man\\nknoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead,\\nyea, the record of this people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and\\nsecond year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be\\nfulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and\\ngreater miracles wrought among the people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:5\\n 5 But there were some who began to say that the time was past\\nfor the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the\\nLamanite.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:6\\n 6 And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold\\nthe time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled;\\ntherefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath\\nbeen vain.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar\\nthroughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very\\nsorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken\\nmight not come to pass.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:8\\n 8 But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that\\nnight and that day which should be as one day as if there were no\\nnight, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:9\\n 9 Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the\\nunbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions\\nshould be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which\\nhad been given by Samuel the prophet.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:10\\n 10 Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw\\nthis wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly\\nsorrowful.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down\\nupon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his\\npeople, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of\\ntheir faith in the tradition of their fathers.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord, all\\nthat day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him,\\nsaying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:13\\n 13 Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time\\nis at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the\\nmorrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will\\nfulfill all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of\\nmy holy prophets.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:14\\n 14 Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfill all things which I\\nhave made known unto the children of men from the foundation of\\nthe world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the\\nSon--of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my\\nflesh.  And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the\\nsign be given.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were\\nfulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the\\ngoing down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began\\nto be astonished because there was no darkness when the night\\ncame.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:16\\n 16 And there were many, who had not believed the words of the\\nprophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead,\\nfor they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had\\nlaid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been\\nfrustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at\\nhand.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:17\\n 17 And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly\\nappear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole\\nearth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in\\nthe land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to\\nthe earth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:18\\n 18 For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things\\nfor many years, and that the sign which had been given was\\nalready at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity\\nand their unbelief.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that\\nnight, but it was as light as though it was mid-day.  And it came\\nto pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to\\nits proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord\\nshould be born, because of the sign which had been given.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:20\\n 20 And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit,\\naccording to the words of the prophets.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:21\\n 21 And it came to pass also that a new star did appear,\\naccording to the word.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to\\nbe lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their\\nhearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs\\nand wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings\\nand deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were\\nconverted unto the Lord.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people,\\nand also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which\\nthere was a great remission of sins.  And thus the people began\\nagain to have peace in the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:24\\n 24 And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began\\nto preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no\\nmore expedient to observe the law of Moses.  Now in this thing\\nthey did err, having not understood the scriptures.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:25\\n 25 But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were\\nconvinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known\\nunto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be\\nfulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it\\nmust be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass\\naway till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year\\nwere they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess\\ntheir faults.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:26\\n 26 And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing\\nglad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come\\nto pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy\\nprophets.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also\\npass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who\\ndwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong\\nwere their holds and their secret places that the people could\\nnot overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and\\ndid do much slaughter among the people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they\\nbegan to increase in great degree, because there were many\\ndissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did\\ncause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:29\\n 29 And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the\\nLamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and\\nbegan to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves,\\nand were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and\\ntheir flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.\\n\\n3 Nephi 1:30\\n 30 And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to\\ndecrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the\\nwickedness of the rising generation.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that thus passed away the ninety and fifth\\nyear also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders\\nwhich they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at\\na sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be\\nhard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to\\ndisbelieve all which they had heard and seen--\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:2\\n 2 Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was\\nwrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and\\ndeceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get\\npossession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he\\ndid blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the\\ndoctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in\\nwickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there\\nshould be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go\\nabout, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and\\ncausing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:4\\n 4 And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the\\nninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and\\nalso the ninety and ninth year;\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:5\\n 5 And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of\\nMosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:6\\n 6 And six hundred and nine years had passed away since Lehi left\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:7\\n 7 And nine years had passed away from the time when the sign was\\ngiven, which was spoken of by the prophets, that Christ should\\ncome into the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:8\\n 8 Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period\\nwhen the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore,\\nnine years had passed away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:9\\n 9 And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of\\nthe records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could\\nnowhere be found in all the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the people did still remain in\\nwickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying\\nwhich was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year\\nalso; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:11\\n 11 And it came to pass in the thirteenth year there began to be\\nwars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton\\nrobbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the\\npeople, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much\\ndeath and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient\\nthat all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should\\ntake up arms against them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:12\\n 12 Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto\\nthe Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were\\ncompelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and\\ntheir children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers,\\nyea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of\\ntheir church and of their worship, and their freedom and their\\nliberty.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had\\npassed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction\\nbecause of this war, which had become exceedingly sore.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with\\nthe Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:15\\n 15 And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became\\nwhite like unto the Nephites;\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:16\\n 16 And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly\\nfair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called\\nNephites.  And thus ended the thirteenth year.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:17\\n 17 And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth\\nyear, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did\\ncontinue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the\\npeople of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch\\nthat they did drive them back out of their lands into the\\nmountains and into their secret places.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:18\\n 18 And thus ended the fourteenth year.  And in the fifteenth\\nyear they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because\\nof the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many\\ncontentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many\\nadvantages over them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 2:19\\n 19 And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people\\nin a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did\\nhang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down\\nby it, and this because of their iniquity.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that in the sixteenth year from the\\ncoming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received\\nan epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of\\nrobbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:2\\n 2 Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold,\\nI write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly\\ngreat praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of\\nyour people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your\\nright and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported\\nby the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your\\nproperty, and your country, or that which ye do call so.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:3\\n 3 And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye\\nshould be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand\\nagainst so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at\\nthis time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety\\nfor the word--Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:4\\n 4 And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved\\nthem in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting\\nhatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done\\nunto them, therefore if they should come down against you they\\nwould visit you with utter destruction.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:5\\n 5 Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine\\nown hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in\\nthat which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the\\nfield of battle.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:6\\n 6 Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up\\nunto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your\\npossessions, rather than that they should visit you with the\\nsword and that destruction should come upon you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:7\\n 7 Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with\\nus and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our\\nbrethren that ye may be like unto us--not our slaves, but our\\nbrethren and partners of all our substance.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:8\\n 8 And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an\\noath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I\\nswear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will\\ncommand that my armies shall come down against you, and they\\nshall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay\\nyou, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall\\nbecome extinct.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:9\\n 9 And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the\\nsecret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof\\nI know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have\\nbeen handed down unto us.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:10\\n 10 And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that\\nye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the\\nshedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights\\nand government, who have dissented away from you because of your\\nwickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and\\nexcept ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs.  I am Giddianhi.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:11\\n 11 And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle\\nhe was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of\\nGiddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites,\\nand also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of\\nthose that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged\\nthemselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable\\nrobbers.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:12\\n 12 Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and\\ncould not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a\\nrobber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi,\\nthe governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people\\nshould cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the\\nrobbers should come down against them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:13\\n 13 Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they\\nshould gather together their women, and their children, their\\nflocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were\\ntheir land, unto one place.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:14\\n 14 And he caused that fortifications should be built round about\\nthem, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great.  And\\nhe caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites,\\nor of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be\\nplaced as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them\\nfrom the robbers day and night.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:15\\n 15 Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent\\nof all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in no wise\\nbe delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:16\\n 16 And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of\\nLachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people;\\nand they did exert themselves in their might to do according to\\nthe words of Lachoneus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains\\nover all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time\\nthat the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against\\nthem.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:18\\n 18 Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great\\ncommander of the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his\\nname was Gidgiddoni.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:19\\n 19 Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for\\ntheir chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness)\\nsome one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy;\\ntherefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as\\nalso was the chief judge.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:20\\n 20 Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and\\nlet us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we\\nmay fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:21\\n 21 But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we\\nshould go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their\\nhands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our\\nlands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will\\nnot go against them, but we will wait till they shall come\\nagainst us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will\\ndeliver them into our hands.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:22\\n 22 And it came to pass in the seventeenth year, in the latter\\nend of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth\\nthroughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their\\nhorses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their\\nflocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their\\nsubstance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of\\nthousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had\\nbeen appointed that they should gather themselves together, to\\ndefend themselves against their enemies.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:23\\n 23 And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla,\\nand the land which was between the land Zarahemla  and the land\\nBountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful\\nand the land Desolation.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:24\\n 24 And there were a great many thousand people who were called\\nNephites, who did gather themselves together in this land.  Now\\nLachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together\\nin the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon\\nthe land northward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:25\\n 25 And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and\\nthey did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear\\nthe words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they\\ndid repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers\\nunto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time\\nthat their enemies should come down against them to battle.\\n\\n3 Nephi 3:26\\n 26 And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies.\\n\\nAnd Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of\\nevery kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with\\nshields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that in the latter end of the eighteenth\\nyear those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began\\nto come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the\\nmountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their\\nsecret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both\\nwhich were in the land south and which were in the land north,\\nand began to take possession of all the lands which had been\\ndeserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left\\ndesolate.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:2\\n 2 But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands\\nwhich had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game\\nfor the robbers save it were in the wilderness.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:3\\n 3 And the robbers could not exist save it were in the\\nwilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their\\nlands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and\\nall their substance, and they were in one body.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:4\\n 4 Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and\\nto obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against\\nthe Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so\\ngreat a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions,\\nand horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might\\nsubsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did\\nhope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and\\nthus the eighteenth year did pass away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that in the nineteenth year Giddianhi\\nfound that it was expedient that he should go up to battle\\nagainst the Nephites, for there was no way that they could\\nsubsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:6\\n 6 And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land\\ninsomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should\\ncome upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave\\ncommandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up\\nto battle against the Nephites.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it\\nwas in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the\\nday that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about\\nafter the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their\\nloins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn,\\nand they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was\\nthe appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their\\narmor, and because of their being dyed in blood.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they\\nsaw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to\\nthe earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that\\nhe would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their\\nenemies.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this\\nthey began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for\\nthey had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because\\nof the terror of their armies.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:10\\n 10 But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites\\ndid not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate\\nhim for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did\\nrush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the\\nstrength of the Lord they did receive them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:11\\n 11 And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great\\nand terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was\\nthe slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so\\ngreat a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left\\nJerusalem.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:12\\n 12 And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which\\nGiddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch\\nthat they did fall back from before them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies\\nshould pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and\\nthat they should not spare any that should fall into their hands\\nby the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to\\nthe borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the\\ncommandment of Gidgiddoni.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought\\nwith boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of\\nhis much fighting he was overtaken and slain.  And thus was the\\nend of Giddianhi the robber.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did\\nreturn again to their place of security.  And it came to pass\\nthat this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not\\ncome again to battle; neither did they come again in the\\ntwentieth year.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:16\\n 16 And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to\\nbattle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about\\nthe people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut\\noff the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in\\non every side, and if they should cut them off from all their\\noutward privileges, that they could cause them to yield\\nthemselves up according to their wishes.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:17\\n 17 Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose\\nname was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause\\nthat this siege should take place.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:18\\n 18 But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was\\nimpossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have\\nany effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision\\nwhich they had laid up in store,\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:19\\n 19 And because of the scantiness of provisions among the\\nrobbers--for behold, they had nothing save it were meat for their\\nsubsistence, which meat they did obtain in the wilderness;\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that the wild game became scarce in the\\nwilderness--insomuch that the robbers were about to perish with\\nhunger.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:21\\n 21 And the Nephites were continually marching out by day and by\\nnight, and falling upon their armies, and cutting them off by\\nthousands and by tens of thousands.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:22\\n 22 And thus it became the desire of the people of Zemnarihah to\\nwithdraw from their design, because of the great destruction\\nwhich came upon them by night and by day.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that Zemnarihah did give command unto his\\npeople that they should withdraw themselves from the siege, and\\nmarch into the furthermost parts of the land northward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:24\\n 24 And now, Gidgiddoni being aware of their design, and knowing\\nof their weakness because of the want of food, and the great\\nslaughter which had been made among them, therefore he did send\\nout his armies in the night-time, and did cut off the way of\\ntheir retreat, and did place his armies in the way of their\\nretreat.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:25\\n 25 And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their\\nmarch beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers\\nbegan their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites\\nboth in their front and in their rear.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:26\\n 26 And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in\\ntheir places of retreat.  And all these things were done by\\ncommand of Gidgiddoni.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:27\\n 27 And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up\\nprisoners unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were\\nslain.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:28\\n 28 And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a\\ntree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead.  And when\\nthey had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to\\nthe earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:29\\n 29 May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in\\nholiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth\\nall who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret\\ncombinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:30\\n 30 And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying:\\nMay the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\\nJacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they\\nshall call on the name of their God for protection.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in\\nsinging, and praising their God for the great thing which he had\\ndone for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of\\ntheir enemies.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:32\\n 32 Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God.  And they\\ndid cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most\\nHigh God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 4:33\\n 33 And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out\\nof many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering\\nthem out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was\\nbecause of their repentance and their humility that they had been\\ndelivered from an everlasting destruction.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:1\\n 1 And now behold, there was not a living soul among all the\\npeople of the Nephites who did doubt in the least the words of\\nall the holy prophets who had spoken; for they knew that it must\\nneeds be that they must be fulfilled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:2\\n 2 And they knew that it must be expedient that Christ had come,\\nbecause of the many signs which had been given, according to the\\nwords of the prophets; and because of the things which had come\\nto pass already they knew that it must needs be that all things\\nshould come to pass according to that which had been spoken.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:3\\n 3 Therefore they did forsake all their sins, and their\\nabominations, and their whoredoms, and did serve God with all\\ndiligence day and night.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:4\\n 4 And now it came to pass that when they had taken all the\\nrobbers prisoners, insomuch that none did escape who were not\\nslain, they did cast their prisoners into prison, and did cause\\nthe word of God to be preached unto them; and as many as would\\nrepent of their sins and enter into a covenant that they would\\nmurder no more were set at liberty.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:5\\n 5 But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant,\\nand who did still continue to have those secret murders in their\\nhearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings\\nagainst their brethren were condemned and punished according to\\nthe law.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:6\\n 6 And thus they did put an end to all those wicked, and secret,\\nand abominable combinations, in the which there was so much\\nwickedness, and so many murders committed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:7\\n 7 And thus had the twenty and second year passed away, and the\\ntwenty and third year also, and the twenty and fourth, and the\\ntwenty and fifth; and thus had twenty and five years passed away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:8\\n 8 And there had many things transpired which, in the eyes of\\nsome, would be great and marvelous; nevertheless, they cannot all\\nbe written in this book; yea, this book cannot contain even a\\nhundredth part of what was done among so many people in the space\\nof twenty and five years;\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:9\\n 9 But behold there are records which do contain all the\\nproceedings of this people; and a shorter but true account was\\ngiven by Nephi.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:10\\n 10 Therefore I have made my record of these things according to\\nthe record of Nephi, which was engraven on the plates which were\\ncalled the plates of Nephi.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:11\\n 11 And behold, I do make the record on plates which I have made\\nwith mine own hands.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:12\\n 12 And behold, I am called Mormon, being called after the land\\nof Mormon, the land in which Alma did establish the church among\\nthe people, yea, the first church which was established among\\nthem after their transgression.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:13\\n 13 Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.  I\\nhave been called of him to declare his word among his people,\\nthat they might have everlasting life.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:14\\n 14 And it hath become expedient that I, according to the will of\\nGod, that the prayers of those who have gone hence, who were the\\nholy ones, should be fulfilled according to their faith, should\\nmake a record of these things which have been done--\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:15\\n 15 Yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the\\ntime that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:16\\n 16 Therefore I do make my record from the accounts which have\\nbeen given by those who were before me, until the commencement of\\nmy day;\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:17\\n 17 And then I do make a record of the things which I have seen\\nwith mine own eyes.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:18\\n 18 And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true\\nrecord; nevertheless there are many things which, according to\\nour language, we are not able to write.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:19\\n 19 And now I make an end of my saying, which is of myself, and\\nproceed to give my account of the things which have been before\\nme.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:20\\n 20 I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi.  I have reason to\\nbless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our\\nfathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it\\nwere himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that\\nhe hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the\\nsalvation of our souls.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:21\\n 21 Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been\\nmerciful unto the seed of Joseph.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:22\\n 22 And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his\\ncommandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to\\nhis word.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:23\\n 23 Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of\\nJoseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:24\\n 24 And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he gather in from the\\nfour quarters of the earth all the remnant of the seed of Jacob,\\nwho are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:25\\n 25 And as he hath covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even\\nso shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house\\nof Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all\\nthe house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he\\nhath covenanted with them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 5:26\\n 26 And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ,\\nthe Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four\\nquarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have\\nbeen dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it be.  Amen.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that the people of the Nephites did\\nall return to their own lands in the twenty and sixth year, every\\nman, with his family, his flocks and his herds, his horses and\\nhis cattle, and all things whatsoever did belong unto them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that they had not eaten up all their\\nprovisions; therefore they did take with them all that they had\\nnot devoured, of all their grain of every kind, and their gold,\\nand their silver, and all their precious things, and they did\\nreturn to their own lands and their possessions, both on the\\nnorth and on the south, both on the land northward and on the\\nland southward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:3\\n 3 And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a\\ncovenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to\\nremain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they\\nmight have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and\\nthus they did establish peace in all the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:4\\n 4 And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the\\ntwenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was\\ngreat order in the land; and they had formed their laws according\\nto equity and justice.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:5\\n 5 And now there was nothing in all the land to hinder the people\\nfrom prospering continually, except they should fall into\\ntransgression.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:6\\n 6 And now it was Gidgiddoni, and the judge, Lachoneus, and those\\nwho had been appointed leaders, who had established this great\\npeace in the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that there were many cities built anew,\\nand there were many old cities repaired.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:8\\n 8 And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made,\\nwhich led from city to city, and from land to land, and from\\nplace to place.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:9\\n 9 And thus passed away the twenty and eighth year, and the\\npeople had continual peace.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:10\\n 10 But it came to pass in the twenty and ninth year there began\\nto be some disputings among the people; and some were lifted up\\nunto pride and boastings because of their exceedingly great\\nriches, yea, even unto great persecutions;\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:11\\n 11 For there were many merchants in the land, and also many\\nlawyers, and many officers.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:12\\n 12 And the people began to be distinguished by ranks, according\\nto their riches and their chances for learning, yea, some were\\nignorant because of their poverty, and others did receive great\\nlearning because of their riches.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:13\\n 13 Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly\\nhumble; some did return railing for railing, while others would\\nreceive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions,\\nand would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent\\nbefore God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:14\\n 14 And thus there became a great inequality in all the land,\\ninsomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch\\nthat in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the\\nland save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted\\nunto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they\\nwere firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all\\ndiligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:15\\n 15 Now the cause of this iniquity of the people was this--Satan\\nhad great power, unto the stirring up of the people to do all\\nmanner of iniquity, and to the puffing them up with pride,\\ntempting them to seek for power, and authority, and riches, and\\nthe vain things of the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:16\\n 16 And thus Satan did lead away the hearts of the people to do\\nall manner of iniquity; therefore they had enjoyed peace but a\\nfew years.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:17\\n 17 And thus, in the commencement of the thirtieth year--the\\npeople having been delivered up for the space of a long time to\\nbe carried about by the temptations of the devil whithersoever he\\ndesired to carry them, and to do whatsoever iniquity he desired\\nthey should--and thus in the commencement of this, the thirtieth\\nyear, they were in a state of awful wickedness.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:18\\n 18 Now they did not sin ignorantly, for they knew the will of\\nGod concerning them, for it had been taught unto them; therefore\\nthey did wilfully rebel against God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:19\\n 19 And now it was in the days of Lachoneus, the son of\\nLachoneus, for Lachoneus did fill the seat of his father and did\\ngovern the people that year.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:20\\n 20 And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent\\nforth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and\\ntestifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and\\ntestifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord\\nwould make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of\\nChrist; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:21\\n 21 Now there were many of the people who were exceedingly angry\\nbecause of those who testified of these things; and those who\\nwere angry were chiefly the chief judges, and they who had been\\nhigh priests and lawyers; yea, all those who were lawyers were\\nangry with those who testified of these things.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:22\\n 22 Now there was no lawyer nor judge nor high priest that could\\nhave power to condemn any one to death save their condemnation\\nwas signed by the governor of the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:23\\n 23 Now there were many of those who testified of the things\\npertaining to Christ who testified boldly, who were taken and put\\nto death secretly by the judges, that the knowledge of their\\ndeath came not unto the governor of the land until after their\\ndeath.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:24\\n 24 Now behold, this was contrary to the laws of the land, that\\nany man should be put to death except they had power from the\\ngovernor of the land--\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:25\\n 25 Therefore a complaint came up unto the land of Zarahemla, to\\nthe governor of the land, against these judges who had condemned\\nthe prophets of the Lord unto death, not according to the law.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:26\\n 26 Now it came to pass that they were taken and brought up\\nbefore the judge to be judged of the crime which they had done,\\naccording to the law which had been given by the people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:27\\n 27 Now it came to pass that those judges had many friends and\\nkindreds; and the remainder, yea, even almost all the lawyers and\\nthe high priests, did gather themselves together, and unite with\\nthe kindreds of those judges who were to be tried according to\\nthe law.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:28\\n 28 And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea,\\neven into that covenant which was given by them of old, which\\ncovenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine\\nagainst all righteousness.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:29\\n 29 Therefore they did combine against the people of the Lord,\\nand enter into a covenant to destroy them, and to deliver those\\nwho were guilty of murder from the grasp of justice, which was\\nabout to be administered according to the law.\\n\\n3 Nephi 6:30\\n 30 And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their\\ncountry; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the\\ngovernor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land\\nshould no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:1\\n 1 Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a\\nking over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth\\nyear, they did destroy upon the judgment seat, yea, did murder\\nthe chief judge of the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:2\\n 2 And the people were divided one against another; and they did\\nseparate one from another into tribes, every man according to his\\nfamily and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the\\ngovernment of the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:3\\n 3 And every tribe did appoint a chief or a leader over them; and\\nthus they became tribes and leaders of tribes.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:4\\n 4 Now behold, there was no man among them save he had much\\nfamily and many kindreds and friends; therefore their tribes\\nbecame exceedingly great.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:5\\n 5 Now all this was done, and there were no wars as yet among\\nthem; and all this iniquity had come upon the people because they\\ndid yield themselves unto the power of Satan.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:6\\n 6 And the regulations of the government were destroyed, because\\nof the secret combination of the friends and kindreds of those\\nwho murdered the prophets.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:7\\n 7 And they did cause a great contention in the land, insomuch\\nthat the more righteous part of the people had nearly all become\\nwicked; yea, there were but few righteous men among them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:8\\n 8 And thus six years had not passed away since the more part of\\nthe people had turned from their righteousness, like the dog to\\nhis vomit, or like the sow to her wallowing in the mire.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:9\\n 9 Now this secret combination, which had brought so great\\niniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did\\nplace at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:10\\n 10 And they did call him their king; therefore he became a king\\nover this wicked band; and he was one of the chiefest who had\\ngiven his voice against the prophets who testified of Jesus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that they were not so strong in number as\\nthe tribes of the people, who were united together save it were\\ntheir leaders did establish their laws, every one according to\\nhis tribe; nevertheless they were enemies; notwithstanding they\\nwere not a righteous people, yet they were united in the hatred\\nof those who had entered into a covenant to destroy the\\ngovernment.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:12\\n 12 Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous\\nthan they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded\\nhis people that they should take their flight into the\\nnorthernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves\\na kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he\\nflattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they\\nbecome sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the\\npeople; and they did so.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:13\\n 13 And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded\\nuntil they had gone forth out of the reach of the people.  And\\nthus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the\\npeople of Nephi.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:14\\n 14 And it came to pass in the thirty and first year that they\\nwere divided into tribes, every man according to his family,\\nkindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement\\nthat they would not go to war one with another; but they were not\\nunited as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they\\nwere established according to the minds of those who were their\\nchiefs and their leaders.  But they did establish very strict\\nlaws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch\\nthat in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless,\\ntheir hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did\\nstone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that Nephi--having been visited by angels\\nand also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and\\nbeing eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he\\nmight know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being\\neye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their\\nwickedness and abominations;\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:16\\n 16 Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and\\nthe blindness of their minds--went forth among them in that same\\nyear, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of\\nsins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:17\\n 17 And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them\\ncannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice,\\ntherefore they are not written in this book.  And Nephi did\\nminister with power and with great authority.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even\\nbecause he had greater power than they, for it were not possible\\nthat they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith\\non the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:19\\n 19 And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean\\nspirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after\\nhe had been stoned and suffered death by the people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:20\\n 20 And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry\\nwith him because of his power; and he did also do many more\\nmiracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass\\naway, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord;\\nbut as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people\\nthat they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which\\nwas in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:22\\n 22 And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed\\nof their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest\\nunto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of\\nGod, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and\\ndid do some miracles among the people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:23\\n 23 Thus passed away the thirty and second year also.  And Nephi\\ndid cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and\\nthird year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission\\nof sins.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:24\\n 24 Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none\\nwho were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with\\nwater.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:25\\n 25 Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this\\nministry, that all such as should come unto them should be\\nbaptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before\\nGod, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a\\nremission of their sins.\\n\\n3 Nephi 7:26\\n 26 And there were many in the commencement of this year that\\nwere baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year\\ndid pass away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that according to our record, and we\\nknow our record to be true, for behold, it was a just man who did\\nkeep the record--for he truly did many miracles in the name of\\nJesus; and there was not any man who could do a miracle in the\\nname of Jesus save he were cleansed every whit from his\\niniquity--\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:2\\n 2 And now it came to pass, if there was no mistake made by this\\nman in the reckoning of our time, the thirty and third year had\\npassed away;\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:3\\n 3 And the people began to look with great earnestness for the\\nsign which had been given by the prophet Samuel, the Lamanite,\\nyea, for the time that there should be darkness for the space of\\nthree days over the face of the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:4\\n 4 And there began to be great doubtings and disputations among\\nthe people, notwithstanding so many signs had been given.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:5\\n 5 And it came to pass in the thirty and fourth year, in the\\nfirst month, on the fourth day of the month, there arose a great\\nstorm, such an one as never had been known in all the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:6\\n 6 And there was also a great and terrible tempest; and there was\\nterrible thunder, insomuch that it did shake the whole earth as\\nif it was about to divide asunder.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:7\\n 7 And there were exceedingly sharp lightnings, such as never had\\nbeen known in all the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:8\\n 8 And the city of Zarahemla did take fire.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:9\\n 9 And the city of Moroni did sink into the depths of the sea,\\nand the inhabitants thereof were drowned.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:10\\n 10 And the earth was carried up upon the city of Moronihah that\\nin the place of the city there became a great mountain.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:11\\n 11 And there was a great and terrible destruction in the land\\nsouthward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:12\\n 12 But behold, there was a more great and terrible destruction\\nin the land northward; for behold, the whole face of the land was\\nchanged, because of the tempest and the whirlwinds and the\\nthunderings and the lightnings, and the exceedingly great quaking\\nof the whole earth;\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:13\\n 13 And the highways were broken up, and the level roads were\\nspoiled, and many smooth places became rough.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:14\\n 14 And many great and notable cities were sunk, and many were\\nburned, and many were shaken till the buildings thereof had\\nfallen to the earth, and the inhabitants thereof were slain, and\\nthe places were left desolate.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:15\\n 15 And there were some cities which remained; but the damage\\nthereof was exceedingly great, and there were many of them who\\nwere slain.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:16\\n 16 And there were some who were carried away in the whirlwind;\\nand whither they went no man knoweth, save they know that they\\nwere carried away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:17\\n 17 And thus the face of the whole earth became deformed, because\\nof the tempests, and the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the\\nquaking of the earth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:18\\n 18 And behold, the rocks were rent in twain; they were broken up\\nupon the face of the whole earth, insomuch that they were found\\nin broken fragments, and in seams and in cracks, upon all the\\nface of the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the\\nlightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of\\nthe earth did cease--for behold, they did last for about the\\nspace of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was\\ngreater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were\\ndone in about the space of three hours--and then behold, there\\nwas darkness upon the face of the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that there was thick darkness upon all\\nthe face of the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof who\\nhad not fallen could feel the vapor of darkness;\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:21\\n 21 And there could be no light, because of the darkness, neither\\ncandles, neither torches; neither could there be fire kindled\\nwith their fine and exceedingly dry wood, so that there could not\\nbe any light at all;\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:22\\n 22 And there was not any light seen, neither fire, nor glimmer,\\nneither the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, for so great were\\nthe mists of darkness which were upon the face of the land.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three\\ndays that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning\\nand howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea,\\ngreat were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness\\nand the great destruction which had come upon them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:24\\n 24 And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we\\nhad repented before this great and terrible day, and then would\\nour brethren have been spared, and they would not have been\\nburned in that great city Zarahemla.\\n\\n3 Nephi 8:25\\n 25 And in another place they were heard to cry and mourn,\\nsaying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible\\nday, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them\\nout; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our\\nchildren have been spared, and not have been buried up in that\\ngreat city Moronihah.  And thus were the howlings of the people\\ngreat and terrible.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that there was a voice heard among all the\\ninhabitants of the earth, upon all the face of this land, crying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:2\\n 2 Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the\\nwhole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and\\nhis angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and\\ndaughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and\\nabominations that they are fallen!\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:3\\n 3 Behold, that great city Zarahemla have I burned with fire, and\\nthe inhabitants thereof.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:4\\n 4 And behold, that great city Moroni have I caused to be sunk in\\nthe depths of the sea, and the inhabitants thereof to be drowned.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:5\\n 5 And behold, that great city Moronihah have I covered with\\nearth, and the inhabitants thereof, to hide their iniquities and\\ntheir abominations from before my face, that the blood of the\\nprophets and the saints shall not come any more unto me against\\nthem.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:6\\n 6 And behold, the city of Gilgal have I caused to be sunk, and\\nthe inhabitants thereof to be buried up in the depths of the\\nearth;\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:7\\n 7 Yea, and the city of Onihah and the inhabitants thereof, and\\nthe city of Mocum and the inhabitants thereof, and the city of\\nJerusalem and the inhabitants thereof; and waters have I caused\\nto come up in the stead thereof, to hide their wickedness and\\nabominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets\\nand the saints shall not come up any more unto me against them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:8\\n 8 And behold, the city of Gadiandi, and the city of Gadiomnah,\\nand the city of Jacob, and the city of Gimgimno, all these have I\\ncaused to be sunk, and made hills and valleys in the places\\nthereof; and the inhabitants thereof have I buried up in the\\ndepths of the earth, to hide their wickedness and abominations\\nfrom before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the\\nsaints should not come up any more unto me against them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:9\\n 9 And behold, that great city Jacobugath, which was inhabited by\\nthe people of king Jacob, have I caused to be burned with fire\\nbecause of their sins and their wickedness, which was above all\\nthe wickedness of the whole earth, because of their secret\\nmurders and combinations; for it was they that did destroy the\\npeace of my people and the government of the land; therefore I\\ndid cause them to be burned, to destroy them from before my face,\\nthat the blood of the prophets and the saints should not come up\\nunto me any more against them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:10\\n 10 And behold, the city of Laman, and the city of Josh, and the\\ncity of Gad, and the city of Kishkumen, have I caused to be\\nburned with fire, and the inhabitants thereof, because of their\\nwickedness in casting out the prophets, and stoning those whom I\\ndid send to declare unto them concerning their wickedness and\\ntheir abominations.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:11\\n 11 And because they did cast them all out, that there were none\\nrighteous among them, I did send down fire and destroy them, that\\ntheir wickedness and abominations might be hid from before my\\nface, that the blood of the prophets and the saints whom I sent\\namong them might not cry unto me from the ground against them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:12\\n 12 And many great destructions have I caused to come upon this\\nland, and upon this people, because of their wickedness and their\\nabominations.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:13\\n 13 O all ye that are spared because ye were more righteous than\\nthey, will ye not now return unto me, and repent of your sins,\\nand be converted, that I may heal you?\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:14\\n 14 Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall\\nhave eternal life.  Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards\\nyou, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are\\nthose who come unto me.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:15\\n 15 Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God.  I created the\\nheavens and the earth, and all things that in them are.  I was\\nwith the Father from the beginning.  I am in the Father, and the\\nFather in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:16\\n 16 I came unto my own, and my own received me not.  And the\\nscriptures concerning my coming are fulfilled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:17\\n 17 And as many as have received me, to them have I given to\\nbecome the sons of God; and even so will I to as many as shall\\nbelieve on my name, for behold, by me redemption cometh, and in\\nme is the law of Moses fulfilled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:18\\n 18 I am the light and the life of the world.  I am Alpha and\\nOmega, the beginning and the end.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:19\\n 19 And ye shall offer up unto me no more the shedding of blood;\\nyea, your sacrifices and your burnt offerings shall be done away,\\nfor I will accept none of your sacrifices and your burnt\\nofferings.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:20\\n 20 And ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and\\na contrite spirit.  And whoso cometh unto me with a broken heart\\nand a contrite spirit, him will I baptize with fire and with the\\nHoly Ghost, even as the Lamanites, because of their faith in me\\nat the time of their conversion, were baptized with fire and with\\nthe Holy Ghost, and they knew it not.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:21\\n 21 Behold, I have come unto the world to bring redemption unto\\nthe world, to save the world from sin.\\n\\n3 Nephi 9:22\\n 22 Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little\\nchild, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. \\nBehold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up\\nagain; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth,\\nand be saved.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:1\\n 1 And now behold, it came to pass that all the people of the\\nland did hear these sayings, and did witness of it.  And after\\nthese sayings there was silence in the land for the space of many\\nhours;\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:2\\n 2 For so great was the astonishment of the people that they did\\ncease lamenting and howling for the loss of their kindred which\\nhad been slain; therefore there was silence in all the land for\\nthe space of many hours.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that there came a voice again unto the\\npeople, and all the people did hear, and did witness of it,\\nsaying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:4\\n 4 O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are\\ndescendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how\\noft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her\\nwings, and have nourished you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:5\\n 5 And again, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen\\ngathereth her chickens under her wings, yea, O ye people of the\\nhouse of Israel, who have fallen; yea, O ye people of the house\\nof Israel, ye that dwell at Jerusalem, as ye that have fallen;\\nyea, how oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her\\nchickens, and ye would not.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:6\\n 6 O ye house of Israel whom I have spared, how oft will I gather\\nyou as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will\\nrepent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:7\\n 7 But if not, O house of Israel, the places of your dwellings\\nshall become desolate until the time of the fulfilling of the\\ncovenant to your fathers.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:8\\n 8 And now it came to pass that after the people had heard these\\nwords, behold, they began to weep and howl again because of the\\nloss of their kindred and friends.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that thus did the three days pass away. \\nAnd it was in the morning, and the darkness dispersed from off\\nthe face of the land, and the earth did cease to tremble, and the\\nrocks did cease to rend, and the dreadful groanings did cease,\\nand all the tumultuous noises did pass away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:10\\n 10 And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and\\nthe mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who\\nwere spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into\\njoy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto\\nthe Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:11\\n 11 And thus far were the scriptures fulfilled which had been\\nspoken by the prophets.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:12\\n 12 And it was the more righteous part of the people who were\\nsaved, and it was they who received the prophets and stoned them\\nnot; and it was they who had not shed the blood of the saints,\\nwho were spared--\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:13\\n 13 And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the\\nearth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and\\nthey were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and\\ncrushed to death; and they were not carried away in the\\nwhirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke\\nand of darkness.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:14\\n 14 And now, whoso readeth, let him understand; he that hath the\\nscriptures, let him search them, and see and behold if all these\\ndeaths and destructions by fire, and by smoke, and by tempests,\\nand by whirlwinds, and by the opening of the earth to receive\\nthem, and all these things are not unto the fulfilling of the\\nprophecies of many of the holy prophets.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:15\\n 15 Behold, I say unto you, Yea, many have testified of these\\nthings at the coming of Christ, and were slain because they\\ntestified of these things.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:16\\n 16 Yea, the prophet Zenos did testify of these things, and also\\nZenock spake concerning these things, because they testified\\nparticularly concerning us, who are the remnant of their seed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:17\\n 17 Behold, our father Jacob also testified concerning a remnant\\nof the seed of Joseph.  And behold, are not we a remnant of the\\nseed of Joseph?  And these things which testify of us, are they\\nnot written upon the plates of brass which our father Lehi\\nbrought out of Jerusalem?\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that in the ending of the thirty and\\nfourth year, behold, I will show unto you that the people of\\nNephi who were spared, and also those who had been called\\nLamanites, who had been spared, did have great favors shown unto\\nthem, and great blessings poured out upon their heads, insomuch\\nthat soon after the ascension of Christ into heaven he did truly\\nmanifest himself unto them--\\n\\n3 Nephi 10:19\\n 19 Showing his body unto them, and ministering unto them; and an\\naccount of his ministry shall be given hereafter.  Therefore for\\nthis time I make an end of my sayings.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11\\nChapter 11\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that there were a great multitude\\ngathered together, of the people of Nephi, round about the temple\\nwhich was in the land Bountiful; and they were marveling and\\nwondering one with another, and were showing one to another the\\ngreat and marvelous change which had taken place.\\n3 Nephi 11:2\\n 2 And they were also conversing about this Jesus Christ, of whom\\nthe sign had been given concerning his death.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that while they were thus conversing one\\nwith another, they heard a voice as if it came out of heaven; and\\nthey cast their eyes round about, for they understood not the\\nvoice which they heard; and it was not a harsh voice, neither was\\nit a loud voice; nevertheless, and notwithstanding it being a\\nsmall voice it did pierce them that did hear to the center,\\ninsomuch that there was no part of their frame that it did not\\ncause to quake; yea, it did pierce them to the very soul, and did\\ncause their hearts to burn.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that again they heard the voice, and they\\nunderstood it not.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:5\\n 5 And again the third time they did hear the voice, and did open\\ntheir ears to hear it; and their eyes were towards the sound\\nthereof; and they did look steadfastly towards heaven, from\\nwhence the sound came.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:6\\n 6 And behold, the third time they did understand the voice which\\nthey heard; and it said unto them:\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:7\\n 7 Behold my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, in whom I\\nhave glorified my name--hear ye him.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:8\\n 8 And it came to pass, as they understood they cast their eyes\\nup again towards heaven; and behold, they saw a Man descending\\nout of heaven; and he was clothed in a white robe; and he came\\ndown and stood in the midst of them; and the eyes of the whole\\nmultitude were turned upon him, and they durst not open their\\nmouths, even one to another, and wist not what it meant, for they\\nthought it was an angel that had appeared unto them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that he stretched forth his hand and spake\\nunto the people, saying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:10\\n 10 Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall\\ncome into the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:11\\n 11 And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I\\nhave drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me,\\nand have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the\\nworld, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all\\nthings from the beginning.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\\nthe whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that\\nit had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself\\nunto them after his ascension into heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto them saying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:14\\n 14 Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands\\ninto my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails\\nin my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of\\nIsrael, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for\\nthe sins of the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that the multitude went forth, and thrust\\ntheir hands into his side, and did feel the prints of the nails\\nin his hands and in his feet; and this they did do, going forth\\none by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their\\neyes and did feel with their hands, and did know of a surety and\\ndid bear record, that it was he, of whom it was written by the\\nprophets, that should come.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:16\\n 16 And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for\\nthemselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:17\\n 17 Hosanna!  Blessed be the name of the Most High God!  And they\\ndid fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was\\namong the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come\\nforth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:19\\n 19 And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the\\nLord and did kiss his feet.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:20\\n 20 And the Lord commanded him that he should arise.  And he\\narose and stood before him.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:21\\n 21 And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye\\nshall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:22\\n 22 And again the Lord called others, and said unto them\\nlikewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize.  And he said\\nunto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no\\ndisputations among you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:23\\n 23 Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins\\nthrough your words and desireth to be baptized in my name, on\\nthis wise shall ye baptize them--Behold, ye shall go down and\\nstand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:24\\n 24 And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say,\\ncalling them by name, saying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:25\\n 25 Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in\\nthe name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. \\nAmen.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:26\\n 26 And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth\\nagain out of the water.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:27\\n 27 And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for\\nbehold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and\\nthe Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in\\nme, and the Father and I are one.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:28\\n 28 And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. \\nAnd there shall be no disputations among you, as there have\\nhitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you\\nconcerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto\\nbeen.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:29\\n 29 For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of\\ncontention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father\\nof contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend\\nwith anger, one with another.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:30\\n 30 Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men\\nwith anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that\\nsuch things should be done away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:31\\n 31 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto\\nyou my doctrine.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:32\\n 32 And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the\\nFather hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and\\nthe Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth\\nrecord of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father\\ncommandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:33\\n 33 And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be\\nsaved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:34\\n 34 And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be\\ndamned.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:35\\n 35 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and\\nI bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me\\nbelieveth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear\\nrecord of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy\\nGhost.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:36\\n 36 And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy\\nGhost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the\\nFather, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:37\\n 37 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a\\nlittle child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise\\nreceive these things.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:38\\n 38 And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in\\nmy name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise\\ninherit the kingdom of God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:39\\n 39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and\\nwhoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of\\nhell shall not prevail against them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:40\\n 40 And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish\\nit for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built\\nupon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the\\ngates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and\\nthe winds beat upon them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 11:41\\n 41 Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words\\nwhich I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12\\nChapter 12\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\\nunto Nephi, and to those who had been called, (now the number of\\nthem who had been called, and received power and authority to\\nbaptize, was twelve) and behold, he stretched forth his hand unto\\nthe multitude, and cried unto them, saying: Blessed are ye if ye\\nshall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen\\nfrom among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants; and\\nunto them I have given power that they may baptize you with\\nwater; and after that ye are baptized with water, behold, I will\\nbaptize you with fire and with the Holy Ghost; therefore blessed\\nare ye if ye shall believe in me and be baptized, after that ye\\nhave seen me and know that I am.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:2\\n 2 And again, more blessed are they who shall believe in your\\nwords because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and\\nthat ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall believe\\nin your words, and come down into the depths of humility and be\\nbaptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy\\nGhost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:3\\n 3 Yea, blessed are the poor in spirit who come unto me, for\\ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:4\\n 4 And again, blessed are all they that mourn, for they shall be\\ncomforted.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:5\\n 5 And blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:6\\n 6 And blessed are all they who do hunger and thirst after\\nrighteousness, for they shall be filled with the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:7\\n 7 And blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:8\\n 8 And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:9\\n 9 And blessed are all the peacemakers, for they shall be called\\nthe children of God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:10\\n 10 And blessed are all they who are persecuted for my name's\\nsake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:11\\n 11 And blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute,\\nand shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my\\nsake;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:12\\n 12 For ye shall have great joy and be exceedingly glad, for\\ngreat shall be your reward in heaven; for so persecuted they the\\nprophets who were before you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:13\\n 13 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the\\nsalt of the earth; but if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith\\nshall the earth be salted? The salt shall be thenceforth good for\\nnothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:14\\n 14 Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the\\nlight of this people. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:15\\n 15 Behold, do men light a candle and put it under a bushel? Nay,\\nbut on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the\\nhouse;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:16\\n 16 Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that\\nthey may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in\\nheaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:17\\n 17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets.\\nI am not come to destroy but to fulfil;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:18\\n 18 For verily I say unto you, one jot nor tittle hath not passed\\naway from the law, but in me it hath all been fulfilled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:19\\n 19 And behold, I have given you the law and the commandments of\\nmy Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent\\nof your sins, and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite\\nspirit. Behold, ye have the commandments before you, and the law\\nis fulfilled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:20\\n 20 Therefore come unto me and be ye saved; for verily I say unto\\nyou, that except ye shall keep my commandments, which I have\\ncommanded you at this time, ye shall in no case enter into the\\nkingdom of heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:21\\n 21 Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, and\\nit is also written before you, that thou shalt not kill, and\\nwhosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment of God;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:22\\n 22 But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother\\nshall be in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to\\nhis brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and\\nwhosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:23\\n 23 Therefore, if ye shall come unto me, or shall desire to come\\nunto me, and rememberest that thy brother hast aught against\\nthee--\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:24\\n 24 Go thy way unto thy brother, and first be reconciled to thy\\nbrother, and then come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I\\nwill receive you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:25\\n 25 Agree with thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way\\nwith him, lest at any time he shall get thee, and thou shalt be\\ncast into prison.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:26\\n 26 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come\\nout thence until thou hast paid the uttermost senine. And while\\nye are in prison can ye pay even one senine? Verily, verily, I\\nsay unto you, Nay.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:27\\n 27 Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt\\nnot commit adultery;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:28\\n 28 But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to\\nlust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:29\\n 29 Behold, I give unto you a commandment, that ye suffer none of\\nthese things to enter into your heart;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:30\\n 30 For it is better that ye should deny yourselves of these\\nthings, wherein ye will take up your cross, than that ye should\\nbe cast into hell.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:31\\n 31 It hath been written, that whosoever shall put away his wife,\\nlet him give her a writing of divorcement.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:32\\n 32 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away\\nhis wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to\\ncommit adultery; and whoso shall marry her who is divorced\\ncommitteth adultery.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:33\\n 33 And again it is written, thou shalt not forswear thyself, but\\nshalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:34\\n 34 But verily, verily, I say unto you, swear not at all; neither\\nby heaven, for it is God's throne;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:35\\n 35 Nor by the earth, for it is his footstool;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:36\\n 36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not\\nmake one hair black or white;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:37\\n 37 But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for\\nwhatsoever cometh of more than these is evil.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:38\\n 38 And behold, it is written, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for\\na tooth;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:39\\n 39 But I say unto you, that ye shall not resist evil, but\\nwhosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the\\nother also;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:40\\n 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy\\ncoat, let him have thy cloak also;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:41\\n 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him\\ntwain.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:42\\n 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow\\nof thee turn not away.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:43\\n 43 And behold it is written also, that thou shalt love thy\\nneighbor and hate thine enemy;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:44\\n 44 But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless them that curse\\nyou, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who\\ndespitefully use you and persecute you;\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:45\\n 45 That ye may be the children of your Father who is in heaven;\\nfor he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:46\\n 46 Therefore those things which were of old time, which were\\nunder the law, in me are all fulfilled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:47\\n 47 Old things are done away, and all things have become new.\\n\\n3 Nephi 12:48\\n 48 Therefore I would that ye should be perfect even as I, or\\nyour Father who is in heaven is perfect.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13\\nChapter 13\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:1\\n 1 Verily, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto\\nthe poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be\\nseen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is\\nin heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:2\\n 2 Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet\\nbefore you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the\\nstreets, that they may have glory of men.  Verily I say unto you,\\nthey have their reward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:3\\n 3 But when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy\\nright hand doeth;\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:4\\n 4 That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in\\nsecret, himself shall reward thee openly.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:5\\n 5 And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for\\nthey love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners\\nof the streets, that they may be seen of men.  Verily I say unto\\nyou, they have their reward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:6\\n 6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when\\nthou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and\\nthy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:7\\n 7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen,\\nfor they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:8\\n 8 Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knoweth\\nwhat things ye have need of before ye ask him.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:9\\n 9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in\\nheaven, hallowed be thy name.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:10\\n 10 Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:11\\n 11 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:12\\n 12 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:13\\n 13 For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory,\\nforever.  Amen.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:14\\n 14 For, if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly Father\\nwill also forgive you;\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:15\\n 15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your\\nFather forgive your trespasses.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:16\\n 16 Moreover, when ye fast be not as the hypocrites, of a sad\\ncountenance, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear\\nunto men to fast.  Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:17\\n 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy\\nface;\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:18\\n 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father,\\nwho is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall\\nreward thee openly.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:19\\n 19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth\\nand rust doth corrupt, and thieves break through and steal;\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:20\\n 20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither\\nmoth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break\\nthrough nor steal.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:21\\n 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:22\\n 22 The light of the body is the eye; if, therefore, thine eye be\\nsingle, thy whole body shall be full of light.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:23\\n 23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of\\ndarkness.  If, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness,\\nhow great is that darkness!\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:24\\n 24 No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one\\nand love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise\\nthe other.  Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:25\\n 25 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these\\nwords he looked upon the twelve whom he had chosen, and said unto\\nthem: Remember the words which I have spoken.  For behold, ye are\\nthey whom I have chosen to minister unto this people.  Therefore\\nI say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat,\\nor what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put\\non.  Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:26\\n 26 Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do\\nthey reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth\\nthem.  Are ye not much better than they?\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:27\\n 27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his\\nstature?\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:28\\n 28 And why take ye thought for raiment?  Consider the lilies of\\nthe field how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin;\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:29\\n 29 And yet I say unto you, that even Solomon, in all his glory,\\nwas not arrayed like one of these.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:30\\n 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which\\ntoday is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, even so will he\\nclothe you, if ye are not of little faith.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:31\\n 31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat?  or,\\nWhat shall we drink?  or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:32\\n 32 For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all\\nthese things.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:33\\n 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,\\nand all these things shall be added unto you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 13:34\\n 34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow\\nshall take thought for the things of itself.  Sufficient is the\\nday unto the evil thereof.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14\\nChapter 14\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\\nhe turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto\\nthem again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not,\\nthat ye be not judged.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:2\\n 2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with\\nwhat measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:3\\n 3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,\\nbut considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:4\\n 4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out\\nof thine eye--and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:5\\n 5 Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and\\nthen shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's\\neye.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:6\\n 6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye\\nyour pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their\\nfeet, and turn again and rend you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:7\\n 7 Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find;\\nknock, and it shall be opened unto you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:8\\n 8 For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,\\nfindeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:9\\n 9 Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will\\ngive him a stone?\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:10\\n 10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:11\\n 11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your\\nchildren, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give\\ngood things to them that ask him?\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:12\\n 12 Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do\\nto you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the\\nprophets.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:13\\n 13 Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and\\nbroad is the way, which leadeth to destruction, and many there be\\nwho go in thereat;\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:14\\n 14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which\\nleadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:15\\n 15 Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's\\nclothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\\n\\n3 Nephi 14:16\\n 16 Ye shall know them by their fruits.

Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words\\nunto his disciples, he turned again unto the multitude and said\\nunto them:\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:18\\n 18 Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and\\npray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to\\nhave you, that he may sift you as wheat.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:19\\n 19 Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:20\\n 20 And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is\\nright, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given\\nunto you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:21\\n 21 Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name,\\nthat your wives and your children may be blessed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:22\\n 22 And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not\\nforbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together,\\nbut suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not;\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:23\\n 23 But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and\\nif it so be that they come unto you oft ye shall pray for them\\nunto the Father, in my name.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:24\\n 24 Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the\\nworld.  Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which\\nye have seen me do.  Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the\\nFather, and ye all have witnessed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:25\\n 25 And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go\\naway, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that\\nye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and\\nwhosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led\\ninto temptation.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:26\\n 26 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these\\nwords, he turned his eyes again upon the disciples whom he had\\nchosen, and said unto them:\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:27\\n 27 Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you\\nanother commandment, and then I must go unto my Father that I may\\nfulfil other commandments which he hath given me.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:28\\n 28 And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto\\nyou, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my\\nflesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it;\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:29\\n 29 For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily\\neateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know\\nthat a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye\\nshall forbid him.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:30\\n 30 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but\\nye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the\\nFather, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is\\nbaptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall\\nminister unto him of my flesh and blood.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:31\\n 31 But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my\\npeople, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I know my\\nsheep, and they are numbered.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:32\\n 32 Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues,\\nor your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to\\nminister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent,\\nand come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal\\nthem; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:33\\n 33 Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that\\nye come not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father\\ncondemneth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:34\\n 34 And I give you these commandments because of the disputations\\nwhich have been among you.  And blessed are ye if ye have no\\ndisputations among you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:35\\n 35 And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I\\nshould go unto the Father for your sakes.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these\\nsayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had\\nchosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake\\nunto them as he touched them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:37\\n 37 And the multitude heard not the words which he spake,\\ntherefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bare record\\nthat he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost.  And I will show\\nunto you hereafter that this record is true.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:38\\n 38 And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all,\\nthere came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could\\nnot see Jesus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 18:39\\n 39 And while they were overshadowed he departed from them, and\\nascended into heaven.  And the disciples saw and did bear record\\nthat he ascended again into heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19\\nChapter 19\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ascended into\\nheaven, the multitude did disperse, and every man did take his\\nwife and his children and did return to his own home.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:2\\n 2 And it was noised abroad among the people immediately, before\\nit was yet dark, that the multitude had seen Jesus, and that he\\nhad ministered unto them, and that he would also show himself on\\nthe morrow unto the multitude.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:3\\n 3 Yea, and even all the night it was noised abroad concerning\\nJesus; and insomuch did they send forth unto the people that\\nthere were many, yea, an exceedingly great number, did labor\\nexceedingly all that night, that they might be on the morrow in\\nthe place where Jesus should show himself unto the multitude.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that on the morrow, when the multitude was\\ngathered together, behold, Nephi and his brother whom he had\\nraised from the dead, whose name was Timothy, and also his son,\\nwhose name was Jonas, and also Mathoni, and Mathonihah, his\\nbrother, and Kumen, and Kumenonhi, and Jeremiah, and Shemnon, and\\nJonas, and Zedekiah, and Isaiah--now these were the names of the\\ndisciples whom Jesus had chosen--and it came to pass that they\\nwent forth and stood in the midst of the multitude.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:5\\n 5 And behold, the multitude was so great that they did cause\\nthat they should be separated into twelve bodies.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:6\\n 6 And the twelve did teach the multitude; and behold, they did\\ncause that the multitude should kneel down upon the face of the\\nearth, and should pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:7\\n 7 And the disciples did pray unto the Father also in the name of\\nJesus.  And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto\\nthe people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:8\\n 8 And when they had ministered those same words which Jesus had\\nspoken--nothing varying from the words which Jesus had\\nspoken--behold, they knelt again and prayed to the Father in the\\nname of Jesus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:9\\n 9 And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they\\ndesired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:10\\n 10 And when they had thus prayed they went down unto the water's\\nedge, and the multitude followed them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water and\\nwas baptized.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:12\\n 12 And he came up out of the water and began to baptize.  And he\\nbaptized all those whom Jesus had chosen.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:13\\n 13 And it came to pass when they were all baptized and had come\\nup out of the water, the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they\\nwere filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:14\\n 14 And behold, they were encircled about as if it were by fire;\\nand it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it,\\nand did bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and\\ndid minister unto them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that while the angels were ministering\\nunto the disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the midst and\\nministered unto them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and\\ncommanded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth,\\nand also that his disciples should kneel down upon the earth.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon\\nthe earth, he commanded his disciples that they should pray.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:18\\n 18 And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus,\\ncalling him their Lord and their God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of\\nthem, and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to\\nthe earth, and he said:\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:20\\n 20 Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto\\nthese whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me\\nthat I have chosen them out of the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:21\\n 21 Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto\\nall them that shall believe in their words.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:22\\n 22 Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost because they\\nbelieve in me; and thou seest that they believe in me because\\nthou hearest them, and they pray unto me; and they pray unto me\\nbecause I am with them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:23\\n 23 And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all\\nthose who shall believe on their words, that they may believe in\\nme, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may\\nbe one.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the\\nFather, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still\\ncontinue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not\\nmultiply many words, for it was given unto them what they should\\npray, and they were filled with desire.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray\\nunto him; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light\\nof his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as\\nwhite as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and\\nbehold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea,\\neven there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness\\nthereof.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:26\\n 26 And Jesus said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless they did not\\ncease to pray.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:27\\n 27 And he turned from them again, and went a little way off and\\nbowed himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father,\\nsaying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:28\\n 28 Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I\\nhave chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and\\nalso for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be\\npurified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are\\npurified in me.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:29\\n 29 Father, I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou\\nhast given me out of the world, because of their faith, that they\\nmay be purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art\\nin me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:30\\n 30 And when Jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his\\ndisciples; and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing,\\nunto him; and he did smile upon them again; and behold they were\\nwhite, even as Jesus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that he went again a little way off and\\nprayed unto the Father;\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:32\\n 32 And tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither\\ncan be written by man the words which he prayed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:33\\n 33 And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their\\nhearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the\\nwords which he prayed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:34\\n 34 Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the words which he\\nprayed that they cannot be written, neither can they be uttered\\nby man.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of\\npraying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: So\\ngreat faith have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I\\ncould not show unto them so great miracles, because of their\\nunbelief.\\n\\n3 Nephi 19:36\\n 36 Verily I say unto you, there are none of them that have seen\\nso great things as ye have seen; neither have they heard so great\\nthings as ye have heard.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20\\nChapter 20\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that he commanded the multitude that they\\nshould cease to pray, and also his disciples.  And he commanded\\nthem that they should not cease to pray in their hearts.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:2\\n 2 And he commanded them that they should arise and stand up upon\\ntheir feet.  And they arose up and stood upon their feet.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that he brake bread again and blessed it,\\nand gave to the disciples to eat.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:4\\n 4 And when they had eaten he commanded them that they should\\nbreak bread, and give unto the multitude.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:5\\n 5 And when they had given unto the multitude he also gave them\\nwine to drink, and commanded them that they should give unto the\\nmultitude.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:6\\n 6 Now, there had been no bread, neither wine, brought by the\\ndisciples, neither by the multitude;\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:7\\n 7 But he truly gave unto them bread to eat, and also wine to\\ndrink.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:8\\n 8 And he said unto them: He that eateth this bread eateth of my\\nbody to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine drinketh of\\nmy blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst,\\nbut shall be filled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:9\\n 9 Now, when the multitude had all eaten and drunk, behold, they\\nwere filled with the Spirit; and they did cry out with one voice,\\nand gave glory to Jesus, whom they both saw and heard.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that when they had all given glory unto\\nJesus, he said unto them: Behold now I finish the commandment\\nwhich the Father hath commanded me concerning this people, who\\nare a remnant of the house of Israel.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:11\\n 11 Ye remember that I spake unto you, and said that when the\\nwords of Isaiah should be fulfilled--behold they are written, ye\\nhave them before you, therefore search them--\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:12\\n 12 And verily, verily, I say unto you, that when they shall be\\nfulfilled then is the fulfilling of the covenant which the Father\\nhath made unto his people, O house of Israel.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:13\\n 13 And then shall the remnants, which shall be scattered abroad\\nupon the face of the earth, be gathered in from the east and from\\nthe west, and from the south and from the north; and they shall\\nbe brought to the knowledge of the Lord their God, who hath\\nredeemed them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:14\\n 14 And the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you\\nthis land, for your inheritance.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:15\\n 15 And I say unto you, that if the Gentiles do not repent after\\nthe blessing which they shall receive, after they have scattered\\nmy people--\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:16\\n 16 Then shall ye, who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, go\\nforth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them who shall\\nbe many; and ye shall be among them as a lion among the beasts of\\nthe forest, and as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who,\\nif he goeth through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and\\nnone can deliver.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:17\\n 17 Thy hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all\\nthine enemies shall be cut off.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:18\\n 18 And I will gather my people together as a man gathereth his\\nsheaves into the floor.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:19\\n 19 For I will make my people with whom the Father hath\\ncovenanted, yea, I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy\\nhoofs brass.  And thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I\\nwill consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance\\nunto the Lord of the whole earth.  And behold, I am he who doeth\\nit.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:20\\n 20 And it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that the sword\\nof my justice shall hang over them at that day; and except they\\nrepent it shall fall upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon\\nall the nations of the Gentiles.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:21\\n 21 And it shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O\\nhouse of Israel.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:22\\n 22 And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto\\nthe fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father\\nJacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem.  And the powers of heaven\\nshall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the\\nmidst of you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:23\\n 23 Behold, I am he of whom Moses spake, saying: A prophet shall\\nthe Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto\\nme; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto\\nyou.  And it shall come to pass that every soul who will not hear\\nthat prophet shall be cut off from among the people.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:24\\n 24 Verily I say unto you, yea, and all the prophets from Samuel\\nand those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have\\ntestified of me.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:25\\n 25 And behold, ye are the children of the prophets; and ye are\\nof the house of Israel; and ye are of the covenant which the\\nFather made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in thy\\nseed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:26\\n 26 The Father having raised me up unto you first, and sent me to\\nbless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities;\\nand this because ye are the children of the covenant--\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:27\\n 27 And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth the Father the\\ncovenant which he made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall\\nall the kindreds of the earth be blessed--unto the pouring out of\\nthe Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which blessing upon\\nthe Gentiles shall make them mighty above all, unto the\\nscattering of my people, O house of Israel.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:28\\n 28 And they shall be a scourge unto the people of this land. \\nNevertheless, when they shall have received the fulness of my\\ngospel, then if they shall harden their hearts against me I will\\nreturn their iniquities upon their own heads, saith the Father.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:29\\n 29 And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my\\npeople; and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them\\ntogether in mine own due time, that I would give unto them again\\nthe land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is the\\nland of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto them forever,\\nsaith the Father.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:30\\n 30 And it shall come to pass that the time cometh, when the\\nfulness of my gospel shall be preached unto them;\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:31\\n 31 And they shall believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son\\nof God, and shall pray unto the Father in my name.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:32\\n 32 Then shall their watchmen lift up their voice, and with the\\nvoice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:33\\n 33 Then will the Father gather them together again, and give\\nunto them Jerusalem for the land of their inheritance.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:34\\n 34 Then shall they break forth into joy--Sing together, ye waste\\nplaces of Jerusalem; for the Father hath comforted his people, he\\nhath redeemed Jerusalem.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:35\\n 35 The Father hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the\\nnations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of\\nthe Father; and the Father and I are one.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:36\\n 36 And then shall be brought to pass that which is written:\\nAwake, awake again, and put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy\\nbeautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for henceforth\\nthere shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the\\nunclean.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:37\\n 37 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem;\\nloose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of\\nZion.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:38\\n 38 For thus saith the Lord: Ye have sold yourselves for naught,\\nand ye shall be redeemed without money.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:39\\n 39 Verily, verily, I say unto you, that my people shall know my\\nname; yea, in that day they shall know that I am he that doth\\nspeak.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:40\\n 40 And then shall they say: How beautiful upon the mountains are\\nthe feet of him that bringeth good tidings unto them, that\\npublisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings unto them of good,\\nthat publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion: Thy God\\nreigneth!\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:41\\n 41 And then shall a cry go forth: Depart ye, depart ye, go ye\\nout from thence, touch not that which is unclean; go ye out of\\nthe midst of her; be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:42\\n 42 For ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight; for the\\nLord will go before you, and the God of Israel shall be your\\nrearward.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:43\\n 43 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; he shall be exalted\\nand extolled and be very high.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:44\\n 44 As many were astonished at thee--his visage was so marred,\\nmore than any man, and his form more than the sons of men--\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:45\\n 45 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their\\nmouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they\\nsee; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.\\n\\n3 Nephi 20:46\\n 46 Verily, verily, I say unto you, all these things shall surely\\ncome, even as the Father hath commanded me.

For if\\na church be called in Moses' name then it be Moses' church; or if\\nit be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man;\\nbut if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be\\nthat they are built upon my gospel.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:9\\n 9 Verily I say unto you, that ye are built upon my gospel;\\ntherefore ye shall call whatsoever things ye do call, in my name;\\ntherefore if ye call upon the Father, for the church, if it be in\\nmy name the Father will hear you;\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:10\\n 10 And if it so be that the church is built upon my gospel then\\nwill the Father show forth his own works in it.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:11\\n 11 But if it be not built upon my gospel, and is built upon the\\nworks of men, or upon the works of the devil, verily I say unto\\nyou they have joy in their works for a season, and by and by the\\nend cometh, and they are hewn down and cast into the fire, from\\nwhence there is no return.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:12\\n 12 For their works do follow them, for it is because of their\\nworks that they are hewn down; therefore remember the things that\\nI have told you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:13\\n 13 Behold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is the\\ngospel which I have given unto you--that I came into the world to\\ndo the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:14\\n 14 And my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the\\ncross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I\\nmight draw all men unto me, that as I have been lifted up by men\\neven so should men be lifted up by the Father, to stand before\\nme, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether\\nthey be evil--\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:15\\n 15 And for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore,\\naccording to the power of the Father I will draw all men unto me,\\nthat they may be judged according to their works.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:16\\n 16 And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is\\nbaptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the\\nend, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that\\nday when I shall stand to judge the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:17\\n 17 And he that endureth not unto the end, the same is he that is\\nalso hewn down and cast into the fire, from whence they can no\\nmore return, because of the justice of the Father.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:18\\n 18 And this is the word which he hath given unto the children of\\nmen.  And for this cause he fulfilleth the words which he hath\\ngiven, and he lieth not, but fulfilleth all his words.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:19\\n 19 And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore\\nnothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed\\ntheir garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the\\nrepentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the\\nend.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:20\\n 20 Now this is the commandment: Repent, all ye ends of the\\nearth, and come unto me and be baptized in my name, that ye may\\nbe sanctified by the reception of the Holy Ghost, that ye may\\nstand spotless before me at the last day.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:21\\n 21 Verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and ye\\nknow the things that ye must do in my church; for the works which\\nye have seen me do that shall ye also do; for that which ye have\\nseen me do even that shall ye do;\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:22\\n 22 Therefore, if ye do these things blessed are ye, for ye shall\\nbe lifted up at the last day.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:23\\n 23 Write the things which ye have seen and heard, save it be\\nthose which are forbidden.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:24\\n 24 Write the works of this people, which shall be, even as hath\\nbeen written, of that which hath been.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:25\\n 25 For behold, out of the books which have been written, and\\nwhich shall be written, shall this people be judged, for by them\\nshall their works be known unto men.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:26\\n 26 And behold, all things are written by the Father; therefore\\nout of the books which shall be written shall the world be\\njudged.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:27\\n 27 And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according\\nto the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just.\\n\\nTherefore, what manner of men ought ye to be?  Verily I say unto\\nyou, even as I am.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:28\\n 28 And now I go unto the Father.  And verily I say unto you,\\nwhatsoever things ye shall ask the Father in my name shall be\\ngiven unto you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:29\\n 29 Therefore, ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be\\nopened unto you; for he that asketh, receiveth; and unto him that\\nknocketh, it shall be opened.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:30\\n 30 And now, behold, my joy is great, even unto fulness, because\\nof you, and also this generation; yea, and even the Father\\nrejoiceth, and also all the holy angels, because of you and this\\ngeneration; for none of them are lost.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:31\\n 31 Behold, I would that ye should understand; for I mean them\\nwho are now alive of this generation; and none of them are lost;\\nand in them I have fulness of joy.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:32\\n 32 But behold, it sorroweth me because of the fourth generation\\nfrom this generation, for they are led away captive by him even\\nas was the son of perdition; for they will sell me for silver and\\nfor gold, and for that which moth doth corrupt and which thieves\\ncan break through and steal.  And in that day will I visit them,\\neven in turning their works upon their own heads.\\n\\n3 Nephi 27:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings\\nhe said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at the strait gate; for\\nstrait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and\\nfew there be that find it; but wide is the gate, and broad the\\nway which leads to death, and many there be that travel therein,\\nuntil the night cometh, wherein no man can work.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28\\nChapter 28\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:1\\n 1 And it came to pass when Jesus had said these words, he spake\\nunto his disciples, one by one, saying unto them: What is it that\\nye desire of me, after that I am gone to the Father?\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:2\\n 2 And they all spake, save it were three, saying: We desire that\\nafter we have lived unto the age of man, that our ministry,\\nwherein thou hast called us, may have an end, that we may\\nspeedily come unto thee in thy kingdom.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:3\\n 3 And he said unto them: Blessed are ye because ye desired this\\nthing of me; therefore, after that ye are seventy and two years\\nold ye shall come unto me in my kingdom; and with me ye shall\\nfind rest.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:4\\n 4 And when he had spoken unto them, he turned himself unto the\\nthree, and said unto them: What will ye that I should do unto\\nyou, when I am gone unto the Father?\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:5\\n 5 And they sorrowed in their hearts, for they durst not speak\\nunto him the things which they desired.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:6\\n 6 And he said unto them: Behold, I know your thoughts, and ye\\nhave desired the thing which John, my beloved, who was with me in\\nmy ministry, before that I was lifted up by the Jews, desired of\\nme.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:7\\n 7 Therefore, more blessed are ye, for ye shall never taste of\\ndeath; but ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father\\nunto the children of men, even until all things shall be\\nfulfilled according to the will of the Father, when I shall come\\nin my glory with the powers of heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:8\\n 8 And ye shall never endure the pains of death; but when I shall\\ncome in my glory ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye\\nfrom mortality to immortality; and then shall ye be blessed in\\nthe kingdom of my Father.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:9\\n 9 And again, ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the\\nflesh, neither sorrow save it be for the sins of the world; and\\nall this will I do because of the thing which ye have desired of\\nme, for ye have desired that ye might bring the souls of men unto\\nme, while the world shall stand.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:10\\n 10 And for this cause ye shall have fulness of joy; and ye shall\\nsit down in the kingdom of my Father; yea, your joy shall be\\nfull, even as the Father hath given me fulness of joy; and ye\\nshall be even as I am, and I am even as the Father; and the\\nFather and I are one;\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:11\\n 11 And the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and\\nthe Father giveth the Holy Ghost unto the children of men,\\nbecause of me.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words,\\nhe touched every one of them with his finger save it were the\\nthree who were to tarry, and then he departed.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:13\\n 13 And behold, the heavens were opened, and they were caught up\\ninto heaven, and saw and heard unspeakable things.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:14\\n 14 And it was forbidden them that they should utter; neither was\\nit given unto them power that they could utter the things which\\nthey saw and heard;\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:15\\n 15 And whether they were in the body or out of the body, they\\ncould not tell; for it did seem unto them like a transfiguration\\nof them, that they were changed from this body of flesh into an\\nimmortal state, that they could behold the things of God.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:16\\n 16 But it came to pass that they did again minister upon the\\nface of the earth; nevertheless they did not minister of the\\nthings which they had heard and seen, because of the commandment\\nwhich was given them in heaven.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:17\\n 17 And now, whether they were mortal or immortal, from the day\\nof their transfiguration, I know not;\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:18\\n 18 But this much I know, according to the record which hath been\\ngiven--they did go forth upon the face of the land, and did\\nminister unto all the people, uniting as many to the church as\\nwould believe in their preaching; baptizing them, and as many as\\nwere baptized did receive the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:19\\n 19 And they were cast into prison by them who did not belong to\\nthe church. And the prisons could not hold them, for they were\\nrent in twain.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:20\\n 20 And they were cast down into the earth; but they did smite\\nthe earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his power they\\nwere delivered out of the depths of the earth; and therefore they\\ncould not dig pits sufficient to hold them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:21\\n 21 And thrice they were cast into a furnace and received no\\nhard.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:22\\n 22 And twice were they cast into a den of wild beasts; and\\nbehold they did play with the beasts as a child with a suckling\\nlamb, and received no harm.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that thus they did go forth among all the\\npeople of Nephi, and did preach the gospel of Christ unto all\\npeople upon the face of the land; and they were converted unto\\nthe Lord, and were united unto the church of Christ, and thus the\\npeople of that generation were blessed, according to the word of\\nJesus.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:24\\n 24 And now I, Mormon, make an end of speaking concerning these\\nthings for a time.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:25\\n 25 Behold, I was about to write the names of those who were\\nnever to taste of death, but the Lord forbade; therefore I write\\nthem not, for they are hid from the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:26\\n 26 But behold, I have seen them, and they have ministered unto\\nme.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:27\\n 27 And behold they will be among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles\\nshall know them not.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:28\\n 28 They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know\\nthem not.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:29\\n 29 And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his\\nwisdom that they shall minister unto all the scattered tribes of\\nIsrael, and unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and\\nshall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire\\nmay be fulfilled, and also because of the convincing power of God\\nwhich is in them.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:30\\n 30 And they are as the angels of God, and if they shall pray\\nunto the Father in the name of Jesus they can show themselves\\nunto whatsoever man it seemeth them good.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:31\\n 31 Therefore, great and marvelous works shall be wrought by\\nthem, before the great and coming day when all people must surely\\nstand before the judgment-seat of Christ;\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:32\\n 32 Yea even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and\\nmarvelous work wrought by them, before that judgment day.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:33\\n 33 And if ye had all the scriptures which give an account of all\\nthe marvelous works of Christ, ye would, according to the words\\nof Christ, know that these things must surely come.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:34\\n 34 And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of\\nJesus, and also to them whom he hath chosen and sent among them;\\nfor whoso receiveth not the words of Jesus and the words of those\\nwhom he hath sent receiveth not him; and therefore he will not\\nreceive them at the last day;\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:35\\n 35 And it would be better for them if they had not been born.\\nFor do ye suppose that ye can get rid of the justice of an\\noffended God, who hath been trampled under feet of men, that\\nthereby salvation might come?\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:36\\n 36 And now behold, as I spake concerning those whom the Lord\\nhath chosen, yea, even three who were caught up into the heavens,\\nthat I knew not whether they were cleansed from mortality to\\nimmortality--\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:37\\n 37 But behold, since I wrote, I have inquired of the Lord, and\\nhe hath made it manifest unto me that there must needs be a\\nchange wrought upon their bodies, or else it needs be that they\\nmust taste of death;\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:38\\n 38 Therefore, that they might not taste of death there was a\\nchange wrought upon their bodies, that they might not suffer pain\\nnor sorrow save it were for the sins of the world.\\n\\n3 Nephi 28:39\\n 39 Now this change was not equal to that which shall take place\\nat the last day; but there was a change wrought upon them,\\ninsomuch that Satan could have no power over them, that he could\\nnot tempt them; and they were sanctified in the flesh, that they\\nwere holy, and that the powers of the earth could not hold them.\\n3 Nephi 28:40\\n 40 And in this state they were to remain until the judgment day\\nof Christ; and at that day they were to receive a greater change,\\nand to be received into the kingdom of the Father to go no more\\nout, but to dwell eternally in the heavens.\\n\\n3 Nephi 29\\nChapter 29\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:1\\n 1 And now behold, I say unto you that when the Lord shall see\\nfit, in his wisdom, that these sayings shall come unto the\\nGentiles according to his word, then ye may know that the\\ncovenant which the Father hath made with the children of Israel,\\nconcerning their restoration to the lands of their inheritance,\\nis already beginning to be fulfilled.\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:2\\n 2 And ye may know that the words of the Lord, which have been\\nspoken by the holy prophets, shall all be fulfilled; and ye need\\nnot say that the Lord delays his coming unto the children of\\nIsrael.\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:3\\n 3 And ye need not imagine in your hearts that the words which\\nhave been spoken are vain, for behold, the Lord will remember his\\ncovenant which he hath made unto his people of the house of\\nIsrael.\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:4\\n 4 And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you,\\nthen ye need not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for\\nthe sword of his justice is in his right hand; and behold, at\\nthat day, if ye shall spurn at his doings he will cause that it\\nshall soon overtake you.\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:5\\n 5 Wo unto him that spurneth at the doings of the Lord; yea, wo\\nunto him that shall deny the Christ and his works!\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:6\\n 6 Yea, wo unto him that shall deny the revelations of the Lord,\\nand that shall say the Lord no longer worketh by revelation, or\\nby prophecy, or by gifts, or by tongues, or by healings, or by\\nthe power of the Holy Ghost!\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:7\\n 7 Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain,\\nthat there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that\\ndoeth this shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom\\nthere was no mercy, according to the word of Christ!\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:8\\n 8 Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game\\nof the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for\\nbehold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will\\ndo unto them according to that which he hath sworn.\\n\\n3 Nephi 29:9\\n 9 Therefore ye need not suppose that ye can turn the right hand\\nof the Lord unto the left, that he may not execute judgment unto\\nthe fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the house\\nof Israel.\\n\\n3 Nephi 30\\nChapter 30\\n\\n3 Nephi 30:1\\n 1 Hearken, O ye Gentiles, and hear the words of Jesus Christ,\\nthe Son of the living God, which he hath commanded me that I\\nshould speak concerning you, for, behold he commandeth me that I\\nshould write, saying:\\n\\n3 Nephi 30:2\\n 2 Turn, all ye Gentiles, from your wicked ways; and repent of\\nyour evil doings, of your lyings and deceivings, and of your\\nwhoredoms, and of your secret abominations, and your idolatries,\\nand of your murders, and your priestcrafts, and your envyings,\\nand your strifes, and from all your wickedness and abominations,\\nand come unto me, and be baptized in my name, that ye may receive\\na remission of your sins, and be filled with the Holy Ghost, that\\nye may be numbered with my people who are of the house of Israel.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1\\nFOURTH NEPHI\\nTHE BOOK OF NEPHI\\nWHO IS THE SON OF NEPHI--ONE OF THE DISCIPLES OF JESUS CHRIST\\nAn account of the people of Nephi, according to his record.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the thirty and fourth year passed\\naway, and also the thirty and fifth, and behold the disciples of\\nJesus had formed a church of Christ in all the lands round about.\\n\\nAnd as many as did come unto them, and did truly repent of their\\nsins, were baptized in the name of Jesus; and they did also\\nreceive the Holy Ghost.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:2\\n 2 And it came to pass in the thirty and sixth year, the people\\nwere all converted unto the Lord, upon all the face of the land,\\nboth Nephites and Lamanites, and there were no contentions and\\ndisputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with\\nanother.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:3\\n 3 And they had all things common among them; therefore there\\nwere not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made\\nfree, and partakers of the heavenly gift.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that the thirty and seventh year passed\\naway also, and there still continued to be peace in the land.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:5\\n 5 And there were great and marvelous works wrought by the\\ndisciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick, and\\nraise the dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to\\nreceive their sight, and the deaf to hear; and all manner of\\nmiracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing\\ndid they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:6\\n 6 And thus did the thirty and eighth year pass away, and also\\nthe thirty and ninth, and forty and first, and the forty and\\nsecond, yea, even until forty and nine years had passed away, and\\nalso the fifty and first, and the fifty and second; yea, and even\\nuntil fifty and nine years had passed away.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:7\\n 7 And the Lord did prosper them exceedingly in the land; yea,\\ninsomuch that they did build cities again where there had been\\ncities burned.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:8\\n 8 Yea, even that great city Zarahemla did they cause to be built\\nagain.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:9\\n 9 But there were many cities which had been sunk, and waters\\ncame up in the stead thereof; therefore these cities could not be\\nrenewed.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:10\\n 10 And now, behold, it came to pass that the people of Nephi did\\nwax strong, and did multiply exceedingly fast, and became an\\nexceedingly fair and delightsome people.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:11\\n 11 And they were married, and given in marriage, and were\\nblessed according to the multitude of the promises which the Lord\\nhad made unto them.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:12\\n 12 And they did not walk any more after the performances and\\nordinances of the law of Moses; but they did walk after the\\ncommandments which they had received from their Lord and their\\nGod, continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together\\noft both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that there was no contention among all\\nthe people, in all the land; but there were mighty miracles\\nwrought among the disciples of Jesus.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that the seventy and first year passed\\naway, and also the seventy and second year, yea, and in fine,\\ntill the seventy and ninth year had passed away; yea, even an\\nhundred years had passed away, and the disciples of Jesus, whom\\nhe had chosen, had all gone to the paradise of God, save it were\\nthe three who should tarry; and there were other disciples\\nordained in their stead; and also many of that generation had\\npassed away.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land,\\nbecause of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the\\npeople.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:16\\n 16 And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults, nor\\nwhoredoms, nor lyings, nor murders, nor any manner of\\nlasciviousness; and surely there could not be a happier people\\namong all the people who had been created by the hand of God.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:17\\n 17 There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there\\nLamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the\\nchildren of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:18\\n 18 And how blessed were they!  For the Lord did bless them in\\nall their doings; yea, even they were blessed and prospered until\\nan hundred and ten years had passed away; and the first\\ngeneration from Christ had passed away, and there was no\\ncontention in all the land.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that Nephi, he that kept this last\\nrecord, (and he kept it upon the plates of Nephi) died, and his\\nson Amos kept it in his stead; and he kept it upon the plates of\\nNephi also.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:20\\n 20 And he kept it eighty and four years, and there was still\\npeace in the land, save it were a small part of the people who\\nhad revolted from the church and taken upon them the name of\\nLamanites; therefore there began to be Lamanites again in the\\nland.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that Amos died also, (and it was an\\nhundred and ninety and four years from the coming of Christ) and\\nhis son Amos kept the record in his stead; and he also kept it\\nupon the plates of Nephi; and it was also written in the book of\\nNephi, which is this book.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that two hundred years had passed away;\\nand the second generation had all passed away save it were a few.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:23\\n 23 And now I, Mormon, would that ye should know that the people\\nhad multiplied, insomuch that they were spread upon all the face\\nof the land, and that they had become exceedingly rich, because\\nof their prosperity in Christ.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:24\\n 24 And now, in this two hundred and first year there began to be\\namong them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wearing\\nof costly apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine\\nthings of the world.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:25\\n 25 And from that time forth they did have their goods and their\\nsubstance no more common among them.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:26\\n 26 And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to\\nbuild up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny\\nthe true church of Christ.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that when two hundred and ten years had\\npassed away there were many churches in the land; yea, there were\\nmany churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they\\ndid deny the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did\\nreceive all manner of wickedness, and did administer that which\\nwas sacred unto him to whom it had been forbidden because of\\nunworthiness.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:28\\n 28 And this church did multiply exceedingly because of iniquity,\\nand because of the power of Satan who did get hold upon their\\nhearts.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:29\\n 29 And again, there was another church which denied the Christ;\\nand they did persecute the true church of Christ, because of\\ntheir humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise\\nthem because of the many miracles which were wrought among them.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:30\\n 30 Therefore they did exercise power and authority over the\\ndisciples of Jesus who did tarry with them, and they did cast\\nthem into prison; but by the power of the word of God, which was\\nin them, the prisons were rent in twain, and they went forth\\ndoing mighty miracles among them.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:31\\n 31 Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these miracles, the\\npeople did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even\\nas the Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, according to his\\nword.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:32\\n 32 And they did cast them into furnaces of fire, and they came\\nforth receiving no harm.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:33\\n 33 And they also cast them into dens of wild beasts, and they\\ndid play with the wild beasts even as a child with a lamb; and\\nthey did come forth from among them, receiving no harm.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:34\\n 34 Nevertheless, the people did harden their hearts, for they\\nwere led by many priests and false prophets to build up many\\nchurches, and to do all manner of iniquity.  And they did smite\\nupon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite\\nagain.  And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness,\\nfrom year to year, even until two hundred and thirty years had\\npassed away.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:35\\n 35 And now it came to pass in this year, yea, in the two hundred\\nand thirty and first year, there was a great division among the\\npeople.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that in this year there arose a people\\nwho were called the Nephites, and they were true believers in\\nChrist; and among them there were those who were called by the\\nLamanites--Jacobites, and Josephites, and Zoramites;\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:37\\n 37 Therefore the true believers in Christ, and the true\\nworshipers of Christ, (among whom were the three disciples of\\nJesus who should tarry) were called Nephites, and Jacobites, and\\nJosephites, and Zoramites.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:38\\n 38 And it came to pass that they who rejected the gospel were\\ncalled Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did\\nnot dwindle in unbelief, but they did wilfully rebel against the\\ngospel of Christ; and they did teach their children that they\\nshould not believe, even as their fathers, from the beginning,\\ndid dwindle.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:39\\n 39 And it was because of the wickedness and abomination of their\\nfathers, even as it was in the beginning.  And they were taught\\nto hate the children of God, even as the Lamanites were taught to\\nhate the children of Nephi from the beginning.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:40\\n 40 And it came to pass that two hundred and forty and four years\\nhad passed away, and thus were the affairs of the people.  And\\nthe more wicked part of the people did wax strong, and became\\nexceedingly more numerous than were the people of God.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:41\\n 41 And they did still continue to build up churches unto\\nthemselves, and adorn them with all manner of precious things. \\nAnd thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two\\nhundred and sixty years.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:42\\n 42 And it came to pass that the wicked part of the people began\\nagain to build up the secret oaths and combinations of Gadianton.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:43\\n 43 And also the people who were called the people of Nephi began\\nto be proud in their hearts, because of their exceeding riches,\\nand become vain like unto their brethren, the Lamanites.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:44\\n 44 And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins\\nof the world.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:45\\n 45 And it came to pass that when three hundred years had passed\\naway, both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become\\nexceedingly wicked one like unto another.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:46\\n 46 And it came to pass that the robbers of Gadianton did spread\\nover all the face of the land; and there were none that were\\nrighteous save it were the disciples of Jesus.  And gold and\\nsilver did they lay up in store in abundance, and did traffic in\\nall manner of traffic.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:47\\n 47 And it came to pass that after three hundred and five years\\nhad passed away, (and the people did still remain in wickedness)\\nAmos died; and his brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his\\nstead.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:48\\n 48 And it came to pass that when three hundred and twenty years\\nhad passed away, Ammaron, being constrained by the Holy Ghost,\\ndid hide up the records which were sacred--yea, even all the\\nsacred records which had been handed down from generation to\\ngeneration, which were sacred--even until the three hundred and\\ntwentieth year from the coming of Christ.\\n\\n4 Nephi 1:49\\n 49 And he did hide them up unto the Lord that they might come\\nagain unto the remnant of the house of Jacob according to the\\nprophecies and the promises of the Lord.  And thus is the end of\\nthe record of Ammaron.\\n\\nMormon\\nTHE BOOK OF MORMON\\n\\nMormon 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\nMormon 1:1\\n 1 And now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have\\nboth seen and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.\\n\\nMormon 1:2\\n 2 And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the\\nLord, he came unto me, (I being about ten years of age, and I\\nbegan to be learned somewhat after the manner of the learning of\\nmy people) and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art a\\nsober child, and art quick to observe;\\n\\nMormon 1:3\\n 3 Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four years old I would\\nthat ye should remember the things that ye have observed\\nconcerning this people; and when ye are of that age go to the\\nland Antum, unto a hill which shall be called Shim; and there\\nhave I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred engravings\\nconcerning this people.\\n\\nMormon 1:4\\n 4 And behold, ye shall take the plates of Nephi unto yourself,\\nand the remainder shall ye leave in the place where they are; and\\nye shall engrave on the plates of Nephi all the things that ye\\nhave observed concerning this people.\\n\\nMormon 1:5\\n 5 And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father's\\nname was Mormon) I remembered the things which Ammaron commanded\\nme.\\n\\nMormon 1:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that I, being eleven years old, was\\ncarried by my father into the land southward, even to the land of\\nZarahemla.\\n\\nMormon 1:7\\n 7 The whole face of the land had become covered with buildings,\\nand the people were as numerous almost, as it were the sand of\\nthe sea.\\n\\nMormon 1:8\\n 8 And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war\\nbetween the Nephites, who consisted of the Nephites and the\\nJacobites and the Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was\\nbetween the Nephites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and\\nthe Ishmaelites.\\n\\nMormon 1:9\\n 9 Now the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were\\ncalled Lamanites, and the two parties were Nephites and\\nLamanites.\\n\\nMormon 1:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the war began to be among them in\\nthe borders of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.\\n\\nMormon 1:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that the Nephites had gathered together a\\ngreat number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty\\nthousand.  And it came to pass that they did have in this same\\nyear a number of battles, in which the Nephites did beat the\\nLamanites and did slay many of them.\\n\\nMormon 1:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design,\\nand there was peace settled in the land; and peace did remain for\\nthe space of about four years, that there was no bloodshed.\\n\\nMormon 1:13\\n 13 But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land,\\ninsomuch that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples, and\\nthe work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the\\niniquity of the people.\\n\\nMormon 1:14\\n 14 And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did\\nnot come upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.\\n\\nMormon 1:15\\n 15 And I, being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a\\nsober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and\\nknew of the goodness of Jesus.\\n\\nMormon 1:16\\n 16 And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth\\nwas shut, and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them; for\\nbehold they had wilfully rebelled against their God; and the\\nbeloved disciples were taken away out of the land, because of\\ntheir iniquity.\\n\\nMormon 1:17\\n 17 But I did remain among them, but I was forbidden to preach\\nunto them, because of the hardness of their hearts; and because\\nof the hardness of their hearts the land was cursed for their\\nsake.\\n\\nMormon 1:18\\n 18 And these Gadianton robbers, who were among the Lamanites,\\ndid infest the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof began\\nto hide up their treasures in the earth; and they became\\nslippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could\\nnot hold them, nor retain them again.\\n\\nMormon 1:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that there were sorceries, and\\nwitchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the evil one was\\nwrought upon all the face of the land, even unto the fulfilling\\nof all the words of Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite.\\n\\nMormon 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\nMormon 2:1\\n 1 And it came to pass in that same year there began to be a war\\nagain between the Nephites and the Lamanites.  And\\nnotwithstanding I being young, was large in stature; therefore\\nthe people of Nephi appointed me that I should be their leader,\\nor the leader of their armies.\\n\\nMormon 2:2\\n 2 Therefore it came to pass that in my sixteenth year I did go\\nforth at the head of an army of the Nephites, against the\\nLamanites; therefore three hundred and twenty and six years had\\npassed away.\\n\\nMormon 2:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and\\nseventh year the Lamanites did come upon us with exceedingly\\ngreat power, insomuch that they did frighten my armies; therefore\\nthey would not fight, and they began to retreat towards the north\\ncountries.\\n\\nMormon 2:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angola,\\nand we did take possession of the city, and make preparations to\\ndefend ourselves against the Lamanites.  And it came to pass that\\nwe did fortify the city with our might; but notwithstanding all\\nour fortifications the Lamanites did come upon us and did drive\\nus out of the city.\\n\\nMormon 2:5\\n 5 And they did also drive us forth out of the land of David.\\n\\nMormon 2:6\\n 6 And we marched forth and came to the land of Joshua, which was\\nin the borders west by the seashore.\\n\\nMormon 2:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that we did gather in our people as fast\\nas it were possible, that we might get them together in one body.\\n\\nMormon 2:8\\n 8 But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with\\nLamanites; and notwithstanding the great destruction which hung\\nover my people, they did not repent of their evil doings;\\ntherefore there was blood and carnage spread throughout all the\\nface of the land, both on the part of the Nephites and also on\\nthe part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution\\nthroughout all the face of the land.\\n\\nMormon 2:9\\n 9 And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and\\nhe came against us with an army of forty and four thousand.  And\\nbehold, I withstood him with forty and two thousand.  And it came\\nto pass that I beat him with my army that he fled before me.  And\\nbehold, all this was done, and three hundred and thirty years had\\npassed away.\\n\\nMormon 2:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of\\ntheir iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by\\nSamuel the prophet; for behold no man could keep that which was\\nhis own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and\\nthe magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.\\n\\nMormon 2:11\\n 11 Thus there began to be a mourning and a lamentation in all\\nthe land because of these things, and more especially among the\\npeople of Nephi.\\n\\nMormon 2:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their\\nlamentation and their mourning and their sorrow before the Lord,\\nmy heart did begin to rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and\\nthe long-suffering of the Lord, therefore supposing that he would\\nbe merciful unto them that they would again become a righteous\\npeople.\\n\\nMormon 2:13\\n 13 But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not\\nunto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was\\nrather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not\\nalways suffer them to take happiness in sin.\\n\\nMormon 2:14\\n 14 And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and\\ncontrite spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die. \\nNevertheless they would struggle with the sword for their lives.\\n\\nMormon 2:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again,\\nand I saw that the day of grace was passed with them, both\\ntemporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down\\nin open rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon\\nthe face of the land.  And thus three hundred and forty and four\\nyears had passed away.\\n\\nMormon 2:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and forty and\\nfifth year the Nephites did begin to flee before the Lamanites;\\nand they were pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon,\\nbefore it was possible to stop them in their retreat.\\n\\nMormon 2:17\\n 17 And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron\\nhad deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be\\ndestroyed.  And behold I had gone according to the word of\\nAmmaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a record\\naccording to the words of Ammaron.\\n\\nMormon 2:18\\n 18 And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all\\nthe wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did\\nforbear to make a full account of their wickedness and\\nabominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and\\nabominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been\\nsufficient to behold the ways of man.\\n\\nMormon 2:19\\n 19 And wo is me because of their wickedness; for my heart has\\nbeen filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days;\\nnevertheless, I know that I shall be lifted up at the last day.\\n\\nMormon 2:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi\\nagain were hunted and driven.  And it came to pass that we were\\ndriven forth until we had come northward to the land which was\\ncalled Shem.\\n\\nMormon 2:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and\\nwe did gather in our people as much as it were possible, that\\nperhaps we might save them from destruction.\\n\\nMormon 2:22\\n 22 And it came to pass in the three hundred and forty and sixth\\nyear they began to come upon us again.\\n\\nMormon 2:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did\\nurge them with great energy, that they would stand boldly before\\nthe Lamanites and fight for their wives, and their children, and\\ntheir houses, and their homes.\\n\\nMormon 2:24\\n 24 And my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that\\nthey did not flee from before the Lamanites, but did stand with\\nboldness against them.\\n\\nMormon 2:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of\\nthirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand.  And it came\\nto pass that we did stand before them with such firmness that\\nthey did flee from before us.\\n\\nMormon 2:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue\\nthem with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them;\\nnevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we\\nwere left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide\\nin us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.\\n\\nMormon 2:27\\n 27 And my heart did sorrow because of this the great calamity of\\nmy people, because of their wickedness and their abominations. \\nBut behold, we did go forth against the Lamanites and the robbers\\nof Gadianton, until we had again taken possession of the lands of\\nour inheritance.\\n\\nMormon 2:28\\n 28 And the three hundred and forty and ninth year had passed\\naway.  And in the three hundred and fiftieth year we made a\\ntreaty with the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, in which\\nwe did get the lands of our inheritance divided.\\n\\nMormon 2:29\\n 29 And the Lamanites did give unto us the land northward, yea,\\neven to the narrow passage which led into the land southward. \\nAnd we did give unto the Lamanites all the land southward.\\n\\nMormon 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\nMormon 3:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle\\nagain until ten years more had passed away.  And behold, I had\\nemployed my people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands and\\ntheir arms against the time of battle.\\n\\nMormon 3:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto\\nthis people--Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and\\nbuild up again my church, and ye shall be spared.\\n\\nMormon 3:3\\n 3 And I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain; and they\\ndid not realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and\\ngranted unto them a chance for repentance.  And behold they did\\nharden their hearts against the Lord their God.\\n\\nMormon 3:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that after this tenth year had passed\\naway, making, in the whole, three hundred and sixty years from\\nthe coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle\\nunto me, which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to\\ncome again to battle against us.\\n\\nMormon 3:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that I did cause my people that they\\nshould gather themselves together at the land Desolation, to a\\ncity which was in the borders, by the narrow pass which led into\\nthe land southward.\\n\\nMormon 3:6\\n 6 And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the\\narmies of the Lamanites, that they might not get possession of\\nany of our lands; therefore we did fortify against them with all\\nour force.\\n\\nMormon 3:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and\\nfirst year the Lamanites did come down to the city of Desolation\\nto battle against us; and it came to pass that in that year we\\ndid beat them, insomuch that they did return to their own lands\\nagain.\\n\\nMormon 3:8\\n 8 And in the three hundred and sixty and second year they did\\ncome down again to battle.  And we did beat them again, and did\\nslay a great number of them, and their dead were cast into the\\nsea.\\n\\nMormon 3:9\\n 9 And now, because of this great thing which my people, the\\nNephites, had done, they began to boast in their own strength,\\nand began to swear before the heavens that they would avenge\\nthemselves of the blood of their brethren who had been slain by\\ntheir enemies.\\n\\nMormon 3:10\\n 10 And they did swear by the heavens, and also by the throne of\\nGod, that they would go up to battle against their enemies, and\\nwould cut them off from the face of the land.\\n\\nMormon 3:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly refuse from\\nthis time forth to be a commander and a leader of this people,\\nbecause of their wickedness and abomination.\\n\\nMormon 3:12\\n 12 Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness I\\nhad led them many times to battle, and had loved them, according\\nto the love of God which was in me, with all my heart; and my\\nsoul had been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day long\\nfor them; nevertheless, it was without faith, because of the\\nhardness of their hearts.\\n\\nMormon 3:13\\n 13 And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their\\nenemies, and they have repented not of their sins.\\n\\nMormon 3:14\\n 14 And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them\\nby our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that they would go up unto\\ntheir enemies to battle, and avenge themselves of the blood of\\ntheir brethren, behold the voice of the Lord came unto me saying:\\n\\nMormon 3:15\\n 15 Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and because this people\\nrepented not after I had delivered them, behold, they shall be\\ncut off from the face of the earth.\\n\\nMormon 3:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that I utterly refused to go up against\\nmine enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded me; and I\\ndid stand as an idle witness to manifest unto the world the\\nthings which I saw and heard, according to the manifestations of\\nthe Spirit which had testified of things to come.\\n\\nMormon 3:17\\n 17 Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you,\\nhouse of Israel, when the work shall commence, that ye shall be\\nabout to prepare to return to the land of your inheritance;\\n\\nMormon 3:18\\n 18 Yea, behold, I write unto all the ends of the earth; yea,\\nunto you, twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be judged according\\nto your works by the twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples\\nin the land of Jerusalem.\\n\\nMormon 3:19\\n 19 And I write also unto the remnant of this people, who shall\\nalso be judged by the twelve whom Jesus chose in this land; and\\nthey shall be judged by the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the\\nland of Jerusalem.\\n\\nMormon 3:20\\n 20 And these things doth the Spirit manifest unto me; therefore\\nI write unto you all.  And for this cause I write unto you, that\\nye may know that ye must all stand before the judgment-seat of\\nChrist, yea, every soul who belongs to the whole human family of\\nAdam; and ye must stand to be judged of your works, whether they\\nbe good or evil;\\n\\nMormon 3:21\\n 21 And also that ye may believe the gospel of Jesus Christ,\\nwhich ye shall have among you; and also that the Jews, the\\ncovenant people of the Lord, shall have other witness besides him\\nwhom they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, was the very\\nChrist and the very God.\\n\\nMormon 3:22\\n 22 And I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to\\nrepent and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.\\n\\nMormon 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\nMormon 4:1\\n 1 And now it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty\\nand third year the Nephites did go up with their armies to battle\\nagainst the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.\\n\\nMormon 4:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were\\ndriven back again to the land of Desolation.  And while they were\\nyet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and\\nthey had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take\\npossession of the city Desolation, and did slay many of the\\nNephites, and did take many prisoners.\\n\\nMormon 4:3\\n 3 And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the\\ncity Teancum.  Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the\\nseashore; and it was also near the city Desolation.\\n\\nMormon 4:4\\n 4 And it was because the armies of the Nephites went up unto the\\nLamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for\\nthat, the Lamanites could have had no power over them.\\n\\nMormon 4:5\\n 5 But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked;\\nand it is by the wicked that the wicked are punished; for it is\\nthe wicked that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto\\nbloodshed.\\n\\nMormon 4:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did make preparations\\nto come against the city Teancum.\\n\\nMormon 4:7\\n 7 And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth\\nyear the Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that they\\nmight take possession of the city Teancum also.\\n\\nMormon 4:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by\\nthe Nephites.  And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the\\nLamanites they did again boast of their own strength; and they\\nwent forth in their own might, and took possession again of the\\ncity Desolation.\\n\\nMormon 4:9\\n 9 And now all these things had been done, and there had been\\nthousands slain on both sides, both the Nephites and the\\nLamanites.\\n\\nMormon 4:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the three hundred and sixty and\\nsixth year had passed away, and the Lamanites came again upon the\\nNephites to battle; and yet the Nephites repented not of the evil\\nthey had done, but persisted in their wickedness continually.\\n\\nMormon 4:11\\n 11 And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man\\nto write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood\\nand carnage which was among the people, both of the Nephites and\\nof the Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they\\ndelighted in the shedding of blood continually.\\n\\nMormon 4:12\\n 12 And there never had been so great wickedness among all the\\nchildren of Lehi, nor even among all the house of Israel,\\naccording to the words of the Lord, as was among this people.\\n\\nMormon 4:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did take possession of\\nthe city Desolation, and this because their number did exceed the\\nnumber of the Nephites.\\n\\nMormon 4:14\\n 14 And they did also march forward against the city Teancum, and\\ndid drive the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take many\\nprisoners both women and children, and did offer them up as\\nsacrifices unto their idol gods.\\n\\nMormon 4:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and\\nseventh year, the Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had\\nsacrificed their women and their children, that they did go\\nagainst the Lamanites with exceedingly great anger, insomuch that\\nthey did beat again the Lamanites, and drive them out of their\\nlands.\\n\\nMormon 4:16\\n 16 And the Lamanites did not come again against the Nephites\\nuntil the three hundred and seventy and fifth year.\\n\\nMormon 4:17\\n 17 And in this year they did come down against the Nephites with\\nall their powers; and they were not numbered because of the\\ngreatness of their number.\\n\\nMormon 4:18\\n 18 And from this time forth did the Nephites gain no power over\\nthe Lamanites, but began to be swept off by them even as a dew\\nbefore the sun.\\n\\nMormon 4:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come down against\\nthe city Desolation; and there was an exceedingly sore battle\\nfought in the land Desolation, in the which they did beat the\\nNephites.\\n\\nMormon 4:20\\n 20 And they fled again from before them, and they came to the\\ncity Boaz; and there they did stand against the Lamanites with\\nexceeding boldness, insomuch that the Lamanites did not beat them\\nuntil they had come again the second time.\\n\\nMormon 4:21\\n 21 And when they had come the second time, the Nephites were\\ndriven and slaughtered with an exceedingly great slaughter; their\\nwomen and their children were again sacrificed unto idols.\\n\\nMormon 4:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that the Nephites did again flee from\\nbefore them, taking all the inhabitants with them, both in towns\\nand villages.\\n\\nMormon 4:23\\n 23 And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to\\noverthrow the land, therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did\\ntake up all the records which Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.\\n\\nMormon 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\nMormon 5:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites,\\nand did repent of the oath which I had made that I would no more\\nassist them; and they gave me command again of their armies, for\\nthey looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their\\nafflictions.\\n\\nMormon 5:2\\n 2 But behold, I was without hope, for I knew the judgments of\\nthe Lord which should come upon them; for they repented not of\\ntheir iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without\\ncalling upon that Being who created them.\\n\\nMormon 5:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come against us as\\nwe had fled to the city of Jordan; but behold, they were driven\\nback that they did not take the city at that time.\\n\\nMormon 5:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we\\ndid maintain the city.  And there were also other cities which\\nwere maintained by Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off\\nthat they could not get into the country which lay before us, to\\ndestroy the inhabitants of our land.\\n\\nMormon 5:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had passed by,\\nand the inhabitants thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed\\nby the Lamanites, and their towns, and villages, and cities were\\nburned with fire; and thus three hundred and seventy and nine\\nyears passed away.\\n\\nMormon 5:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth\\nyear the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we\\ndid stand against them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so\\ngreat were their numbers that they did tread the people of the\\nNephites under their feet.\\n\\nMormon 5:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that we did again take to flight, and\\nthose whose flight was swifter than the Lamanites' did escape,\\nand those whose flight did not exceed the Lamanites' were swept\\ndown and destroyed.\\n\\nMormon 5:8\\n 8 And now behold, I, Mormon, do not desire to harrow up the\\nsouls of men in casting before them such an awful scene of blood\\nand carnage as was laid before mine eyes; but I, knowing that\\nthese things must surely be made known, and that all things which\\nare hid must be revealed upon the house-tops--\\n\\nMormon 5:9\\n 9 And also that a knowledge of these things must come unto the\\nremnant of these people, and also unto the Gentiles, who the Lord\\nhath said should scatter this people, and this people should be\\ncounted as naught among them--therefore I write a small\\nabridgment, daring not to give a full account of the things which\\nI have seen, because of the commandment which I have received,\\nand also that ye might not have too great sorrow because of the\\nwickedness of this people.\\n\\nMormon 5:10\\n 10 And now behold, this I speak unto their seed, and also to the\\nGentiles who have care for the house of Israel, that realize and\\nknow from whence their blessings come.\\n\\nMormon 5:11\\n 11 For I know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the\\nhouse of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of\\nthis people; they will sorrow that this people had not repented\\nthat they might have been clasped in the arms of Jesus.\\n\\nMormon 5:12\\n 12 Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of\\nJacob; and they are written after this manner, because it is\\nknown of God that wickedness will not bring them forth unto them;\\nand they are to be hid up unto the Lord that they may come forth\\nin his own due time.\\n\\nMormon 5:13\\n 13 And this is the commandment which I have received; and\\nbehold, they shall come forth according to the commandment of the\\nLord, when he shall see fit, in his wisdom.\\n\\nMormon 5:14\\n 14 And behold, they shall go unto the unbelieving of the Jews;\\nand for this intent shall they go--that they may be persuaded\\nthat Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God; that the\\nFather may bring about, through his most Beloved, his great and\\neternal purpose, in restoring the Jews, or all the house of\\nIsrael, to the land of their inheritance, which the Lord their\\nGod hath given them, unto the fulfilling of his covenant;\\n\\nMormon 5:15\\n 15 And also that the seed of this people may more fully believe\\nhis gospel, which shall go forth unto them from the Gentiles; for\\nthis people shall be scattered, and shall become a dark, a\\nfilthy, and a loathsome people, beyond the description of that\\nwhich ever hath been amongst us, yea, even that which hath been\\namong the Lamanites, and this because of their unbelief and\\nidolatry.\\n\\nMormon 5:16\\n 16 For behold, the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to\\nstrive with their fathers; and they are without Christ and God in\\nthe world; and they are driven about as chaff before the wind.\\n\\nMormon 5:17\\n 17 They were once a delightsome people, and they had Christ for\\ntheir shepherd; yea, they were led even by God the Father.\\n\\nMormon 5:18\\n 18 But now, behold, they are led about by Satan, even as chaff\\nis driven before the wind, or as a vessel is tossed about upon\\nthe waves, without sail or anchor, or without anything wherewith\\nto steer her; and even as she is, so are they.\\n\\nMormon 5:19\\n 19 And behold, the Lord hath reserved their blessings, which\\nthey might have received in the land, for the Gentiles who shall\\npossess the land.\\n\\nMormon 5:20\\n 20 But behold, it shall come to pass that they shall be driven\\nand scattered by the Gentiles; and after they have been driven\\nand scattered by the Gentiles, behold, then will the Lord\\nremember the covenant which he made unto Abraham and unto all the\\nhouse of Israel.\\n\\nMormon 5:21\\n 21 And also the Lord will remember the prayers of the righteous,\\nwhich have been put up unto him for them.\\n\\nMormon 5:22\\n 22 And then, O ye Gentiles, how can ye stand before the power of\\nGod, except ye shall repent and turn from your evil ways?\\n\\nMormon 5:23\\n 23 Know ye not that ye are in the hands of God?  Know ye not\\nthat he hath all power, and at his great command the earth shall\\nbe rolled together as a scroll?\\n\\nMormon 5:24\\n 24 Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest\\nhe shall come out in justice against you--lest a remnant of the\\nseed of Jacob shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in\\npieces, and there is none to deliver.\\n\\nMormon 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\nMormon 6:1\\n 1 And now I finish my record concerning the destruction of my\\npeople, the Nephites.  And it came to pass that we did march\\nforth before the Lamanites.\\n\\nMormon 6:2\\n 2 And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of the\\nLamanites, and desired of him that he would grant unto us that we\\nmight gather together our people unto the land of Cumorah, by a\\nhill which was called Cumorah, and there we could give them\\nbattle.\\n\\nMormon 6:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites did grant\\nunto me the thing which I desired.\\n\\nMormon 6:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that we did march forth to the land of\\nCumorah, and we did pitch our tents around about the hill\\nCumorah; and it was in a land of many waters, rivers, and\\nfountains; and here we had hope to gain advantage over the\\nLamanites.\\n\\nMormon 6:5\\n 5 And when three hundred and eighty and four years had passed\\naway, we had gathered in all the remainder of our people unto the\\nland of Cumorah.\\n\\nMormon 6:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that when we had gathered in all our\\npeople in one to the land of Cumorah, behold I, Mormon, began to\\nbe old; and knowing it to be the last struggle of my people, and\\nhaving been commanded of the Lord that I should not suffer the\\nrecords which had been handed down by our fathers, which were\\nsacred, to fall into the hands of the Lamanites, (for the\\nLamanites would destroy them) therefore I made this record out of\\nthe plates of Nephi, and hid up in the hill Cumorah all the\\nrecords which had been entrusted to me by the hand of the Lord,\\nsave it were these few plates which I gave unto my son Moroni.\\n\\nMormon 6:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that my people, with their wives and their\\nchildren, did now behold the armies of the Lamanites marching\\ntowards them; and with that awful fear of death which fills the\\nbreasts of all the wicked, did they await to receive them.\\n\\nMormon 6:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that they came to battle against us, and\\nevery soul was filled with terror because of the greatness of\\ntheir numbers.\\n\\nMormon 6:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they did fall upon my people with the\\nsword, and with the bow, and with the arrow, and with the ax, and\\nwith all manner of weapons of war.\\n\\nMormon 6:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that my men were hewn down, yea, even my\\nten thousand who were with me, and I fell wounded in the midst;\\nand they passed by me that they did not put an end to my life.\\n\\nMormon 6:11\\n 11 And when they had gone through and hewn down all my people\\nsave it were twenty and four of us, (among whom was my son\\nMoroni) and we having survived the dead of our people, did behold\\non the morrow, when the Lamanites had returned unto their camps,\\nfrom the top of the hill Cumorah, the ten thousand of my people\\nwho were hewn down, being led in the front by me.\\n\\nMormon 6:12\\n 12 And we also beheld the ten thousand of my people who were led\\nby my son Moroni.\\n\\nMormon 6:13\\n 13 And behold, the ten thousand of Gidgiddonah had fallen, and\\nhe also in the midst.\\n\\nMormon 6:14\\n 14 And Lamah had fallen with his ten thousand; and Gilgal had\\nfallen with his ten thousand; and Limhah had fallen with his ten\\nthousand; and Jeneum had fallen with his ten thousand; and\\nCumenihah, and Moronihah, and Antionum, and Shiblom, and Shem,\\nand Josh, had fallen with their ten thousand each.\\n\\nMormon 6:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that there were ten more who did fall by\\nthe sword, with their ten thousand each; yea, even all my people,\\nsave it were those twenty and four who were with me, and also a\\nfew who had escaped into the south countries, and a few who had\\ndeserted over unto the Lamanites, had fallen; and their flesh,\\nand bones, and blood lay upon the face of the earth, being left\\nby the hands of those who slew them to molder upon the land, and\\nto crumble and to return to their mother earth.\\n\\nMormon 6:16\\n 16 And my soul was rent with anguish, because of the slain of my\\npeople, and I cried:\\n\\nMormon 6:17\\n 17 O ye fair ones, how could ye have departed from the ways of\\nthe Lord!  O ye fair ones, how could ye have rejected that Jesus,\\nwho stood with open arms to receive you!\\n\\nMormon 6:18\\n 18 Behold, if ye had not done this, ye would not have fallen. \\nBut behold, ye are fallen, and I mourn your loss.\\n\\nMormon 6:19\\n 19 O ye fair sons and daughters, ye fathers and mothers, ye\\nhusbands and wives, ye fair ones, how is it that ye could have\\nfallen!\\n\\nMormon 6:20\\n 20 But behold, ye are gone, and my sorrows cannot bring your\\nreturn.\\n\\nMormon 6:21\\n 21 And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on\\nimmortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in\\ncorruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye\\nmust stand before the judgment-seat of Christ to be judged\\naccording to your works and if it so be that ye are righteous,\\nthen are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.\\n\\nMormon 6:22\\n 22 O that ye had repented before this great destruction had come\\nupon you.  But behold, ye are gone, and the Father, yea, the\\nEternal Father of heaven, knoweth your state; and he doeth with\\nyou according to his justice and mercy.\\n\\nMormon 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\nMormon 7:1\\n 1 And now, behold, I would speak somewhat unto the remnant of\\nthis people who are spared, if it so be that God may give unto\\nthem my words, that they may know of the things of their fathers;\\nyea, I speak unto you, ye remnant of the house of Israel; and\\nthese are the words which I speak:\\n\\nMormon 7:2\\n 2 Know ye that ye are of the house of Israel.\\n\\nMormon 7:3\\n 3 Know ye that ye must come unto repentance, or ye cannot be\\nsaved.\\n\\nMormon 7:4\\n 4 Know ye that ye must lay down your weapons of war, and delight\\nno more in the shedding of blood, and take them not again, save\\nit be that God shall command you.\\n\\nMormon 7:5\\n 5 Know ye that ye must come to the knowledge of your fathers,\\nand repent of all your sins and iniquities, and believe in Jesus\\nChrist, that he is the Son of God, and that he was slain by the\\nJews, and by the power of the Father he hath risen again, whereby\\nhe hath gained the victory over the grave; and also in him is the\\nsting of death swallowed up.\\n\\nMormon 7:6\\n 6 And he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead, whereby\\nman must be raised to stand before his judgment-seat.\\n\\nMormon 7:7\\n 7 And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world,\\nwhereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day\\nhath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his\\nkingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto\\nthe Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are\\none God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.\\n\\nMormon 7:8\\n 8 Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and\\nlay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before\\nyou, not only in this record but also in the record which shall\\ncome unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come\\nfrom the Gentiles unto you.\\n\\nMormon 7:9\\n 9 For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe\\nthat; and if ye believe that ye will believe this also; and if ye\\nbelieve this ye will know concerning your fathers, and also the\\nmarvelous works which were wrought by the power of God among\\nthem.\\n\\nMormon 7:10\\n 10 And ye will also know that ye are a remnant of the seed of\\nJacob; therefore ye are numbered among the people of the first\\ncovenant; and if it so be that ye believe in Christ, and are\\nbaptized, first with water, then with fire and with the Holy\\nGhost, following the example of our Savior, according to that\\nwhich he hath commanded us, it shall be well with you in the day\\nof judgment.  Amen.\\n\\nMormon 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\nMormon 8:1\\n 1 Behold I, Moroni, do finish the record of my father, Mormon. \\nBehold, I have but few things to write, which things I have been\\ncommanded by my father.\\n\\nMormon 8:2\\n 2 And now it came to pass that after the great and tremendous\\nbattle at Cumorah, behold, the Nephites who had escaped into the\\ncountry southward were hunted by the Lamanites, until they were\\nall destroyed.\\n\\nMormon 8:3\\n 3 And my father also was killed by them, and I even remain alone\\nto write the sad tale of the destruction of my people.  But\\nbehold, they are gone, and I fulfil the commandment of my father.\\n\\nAnd whether they will slay me, I know not.\\n\\nMormon 8:4\\n 4 Therefore I will write and hide up the records in the earth;\\nand whither I go it mattereth not.\\n\\nMormon 8:5\\n 5 Behold, my father hath made this record, and he hath written\\nthe intent thereof.  And behold, I would write it also if I had\\nroom upon the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none, for I\\nam alone.  My father hath been slain in battle, and all my\\nkinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long\\nthe Lord will suffer that I may live I know not.\\n\\nMormon 8:6\\n 6 Behold, four hundred years have passed away since the coming\\nof our Lord and Savior.\\n\\nMormon 8:7\\n 7 And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people, the Nephites,\\ndown from city to city and from place to place, even until they\\nare no more; and great has been their fall; yea, great and\\nmarvelous is the destruction of my people, the Nephites.\\n\\nMormon 8:8\\n 8 And behold, it is the hand of the Lord which hath done it. \\nAnd behold also, the Lamanites are at war one with another; and\\nthe whole face of this land is one continual round of murder and\\nbloodshed; and no one knoweth the end of the war.\\n\\nMormon 8:9\\n 9 And now, behold, I say no more concerning them, for there are\\nnone save it be the Lamanites and robbers that do exist upon the\\nface of the land.\\n\\nMormon 8:10\\n 10 And there are none that do know the true God save it be the\\ndisciples of Jesus, who did tarry in the land until the\\nwickedness of the people was so great that the Lord would not\\nsuffer them to remain with the people; and whether they be upon\\nthe face of the land no man knoweth.\\n\\nMormon 8:11\\n 11 But behold, my father and I have seen them, and they have\\nministered unto us.\\n\\nMormon 8:12\\n 12 And whoso receiveth this record, and shall not condemn it\\nbecause of the imperfections which are in it, the same shall know\\nof greater things than these.  Behold, I am Moroni; and were it\\npossible, I would make all things known unto you.\\n\\nMormon 8:13\\n 13 Behold, I make an end of speaking concerning this people.  I\\nam the son of Mormon, and my father was a descendant of Nephi.\\n\\nMormon 8:14\\n 14 And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord;\\nthe plates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of\\nthe Lord.  For he truly saith that no one shall have them to get\\ngain; but the record thereof is of great worth; and whoso shall\\nbring it to light, him will the Lord bless.\\n\\nMormon 8:15\\n 15 For none can have power to bring it to light save it be given\\nhim of God; for God wills that it shall be done with an eye\\nsingle to his glory, or the welfare of the ancient and long\\ndispersed covenant people of the Lord.\\n\\nMormon 8:16\\n 16 And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for\\nit shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the\\nword of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it\\nshall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of\\nthe people; and it shall be done by the power of God.\\n\\nMormon 8:17\\n 17 And if there be faults they be the faults of a man.  But\\nbehold, we know no fault; nevertheless God knoweth all things;\\ntherefore, he that condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be\\nin danger of hell fire.\\n\\nMormon 8:18\\n 18 And he that saith: Show unto me, or ye shall be smitten--let\\nhim beware lest he commandeth that which is forbidden of the\\nLord.\\n\\nMormon 8:19\\n 19 For behold, the same that judgeth rashly shall be judged\\nrashly again; for according to his works shall his wages be;\\ntherefore, he that smiteth shall be smitten again, of the Lord.\\n\\nMormon 8:20\\n 20 Behold what the scripture says--man shall not smite, neither\\nshall he judge; for judgment is mine, saith the Lord, and\\nvengeance is mine also, and I will repay.\\n\\nMormon 8:21\\n 21 And he that shall breathe out wrath and strifes against the\\nwork of the Lord, and against the covenant people of the Lord who\\nare the house of Israel, and shall say: We will destroy the work\\nof the Lord, and the Lord will not remember his covenant which he\\nhath made unto the house of Israel--the same is in danger to be\\nhewn down and cast into the fire;\\n\\nMormon 8:22\\n 22 For the eternal purposes of the Lord shall roll on, until all\\nhis promises shall be fulfilled.\\n\\nMormon 8:23\\n 23 Search the prophecies of Isaiah.  Behold, I cannot write\\nthem.  Yea, behold I say unto you, that those saints who have\\ngone before me, who have possessed this land, shall cry, yea,\\neven from the dust will they cry unto the Lord; and as the Lord\\nliveth he will remember the covenant which he hath made with\\nthem.\\n\\nMormon 8:24\\n 24 And he knoweth their prayers, that they were in behalf of\\ntheir brethren.  And he knoweth their faith, for in his name\\ncould they remove mountains; and in his name could they cause the\\nearth to shake; and by the power of his word did they cause\\nprisons to tumble to the earth; yea, even the fiery furnace could\\nnot harm them, neither wild beasts nor poisonous serpents,\\nbecause of the power of his word.\\n\\nMormon 8:25\\n 25 And behold, their prayers were also in behalf of him that the\\nLord should suffer to bring these things forth.\\n\\nMormon 8:26\\n 26 And no one need say they shall not come, for they surely\\nshall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the earth shall\\nthey come, by the hand of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it\\nshall come in a day when it shall be said that miracles are done\\naway; and it shall come even as if one should speak from the\\ndead.\\n\\nMormon 8:27\\n 27 And it shall come in a day when the blood of saints shall cry\\nunto the Lord, because of secret combinations and the works of\\ndarkness.\\n\\nMormon 8:28\\n 28 Yea, it shall come in a day when the power of God shall be\\ndenied, and churches become defiled and be lifted up in the pride\\nof their hearts; yea, even in a day when leaders of churches and\\nteachers shall rise in the pride of their hearts, even to the\\nenvying of them who belong to their churches.\\n\\nMormon 8:29\\n 29 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be heard of\\nfires, and tempests, and vapors of smoke in foreign lands;\\n\\nMormon 8:30\\n 30 And there shall also be heard of wars, rumors of wars, and\\nearthquakes in divers places.\\n\\nMormon 8:31\\n 31 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be great\\npollutions upon the face of the earth; there shall be murders,\\nand robbing, and lying, and deceivings, and whoredoms, and all\\nmanner of abominations; when there shall be many who will say, Do\\nthis, or do that, and it mattereth not, for the Lord will uphold\\nsuch at the last day.  But wo unto such for they are in the gall\\nof bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity.\\n\\nMormon 8:32\\n 32 Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches\\nbuilt up that shall say: Come unto me, and for your money you\\nshall be forgiven of your sins.\\n\\nMormon 8:33\\n 33 O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye\\nbuilt up churches unto yourselves to get gain?  Why have ye\\ntransfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation\\nupon your souls?  Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God;\\nfor behold, the time cometh at that day when all these things\\nmust be fulfilled.\\n\\nMormon 8:34\\n 34 Behold, the Lord hath shown unto me great and marvelous\\nthings concerning that which must shortly come, at that day when\\nthese things shall come forth among you.\\n\\nMormon 8:35\\n 35 Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye\\nare not.  But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I\\nknow your doing.\\n\\nMormon 8:36\\n 36 And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and\\nthere are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in\\nthe pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel,\\nunto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all\\nmanner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one,\\nhave become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.\\n\\nMormon 8:37\\n 37 For behold, ye do love money, and your substance, and your\\nfine apparel, and the adorning of your churches, more than ye\\nlove the poor and the needy, the sick and the afflicted.\\n\\nMormon 8:38\\n 38 O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell\\nyourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the\\nholy church of God?  Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name\\nof Christ?  Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an\\nendless happiness than that misery which never dies--because of\\nthe praise of the world?\\n\\nMormon 8:39\\n 39 Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and\\nyet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick\\nand the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?\\n\\nMormon 8:40\\n 40 Yea, why do ye build up your secret abominations to get gain,\\nand cause that widows should mourn before the Lord, and also\\norphans to mourn before the Lord, and also the blood of their\\nfathers and their husbands to cry unto the Lord from the ground,\\nfor vengeance upon your heads?\\n\\nMormon 8:41\\n 41 Behold, the sword of vengeance hangeth over you; and the time\\nsoon cometh that he avengeth the blood of the saints upon you,\\nfor he will not suffer their cries any longer.\\n\\nMormon 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\nMormon 9:1\\n 1 And now, I speak also concerning those who do not believe in\\nChrist.\\n\\nMormon 9:2\\n 2 Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation--behold,\\nwhen the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth\\nshall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt\\nwith fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye shall be\\nbrought to stand before the Lamb of God--then will ye say that\\nthere is no God?\\n\\nMormon 9:3\\n 3 Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb\\nof God?  Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a\\nconsciousness of your guilt?  Do ye suppose that ye could be\\nhappy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls are racked\\nwith a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his laws?\\n\\nMormon 9:4\\n 4 Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to\\ndwell with a holy and just God, under a consciousness of your\\nfilthiness before him, than ye would to dwell with the damned\\nsouls in hell.\\n\\nMormon 9:5\\n 5 For behold, when ye shall be brought to see your nakedness\\nbefore God, and also the glory of God, and the holiness of Jesus\\nChrist, it will kindle a flame of unquenchable fire upon you.\\n\\nMormon 9:6\\n 6 O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily\\nunto the Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be\\nfound spotless, pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by\\nthe blood of the Lamb, at that great and last day.\\n\\nMormon 9:7\\n 7 And again I speak unto you who deny the revelations of God,\\nand say that they are done away, that there are no revelations,\\nnor prophecies, nor gifts, nor healing, nor speaking with\\ntongues, and the interpretation of tongues;\\n\\nMormon 9:8\\n 8 Behold I say unto you, he that denieth these things knoweth\\nnot the gospel of Christ; yea, he has not read the scriptures; if\\nso, he does not understand them.\\n\\nMormon 9:9\\n 9 For do we not read that God is the same yesterday, today, and\\nforever, and in him there is no variableness neither shadow of\\nchanging?\\n\\nMormon 9:10\\n 10 And now if ye have imagined up unto yourselves a god who doth\\nvary, and in whom there is shadow of changing, then have ye\\nimagined up unto yourselves a god who is not God of miracles.\\n\\nMormon 9:11\\n 11 But behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the\\nGod of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and\\nit is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\\nall things that in them are.\\n\\nMormon 9:12\\n 12 Behold he created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. \\nAnd because of the fall of man came Jesus Christ, even the Father\\nand the Son; and because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of\\nman.\\n\\nMormon 9:13\\n 13 And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus\\nChrist, they are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea,\\nthis is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ\\nbringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a\\nredemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men shall\\nbe awakened by the power of God when the trump shall sound; and\\nthey shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand\\nbefore his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this eternal band\\nof death, which death is a temporal death.\\n\\nMormon 9:14\\n 14 And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and\\nthen cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy\\nstill; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that\\nis happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be\\nunhappy still.\\n\\nMormon 9:15\\n 15 And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god\\nwho can do no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things\\npassed, of which I have spoken?  Has the end come yet?  Behold I\\nsay unto you, Nay; and God has not ceased to be a God of\\nmiracles.\\n\\nMormon 9:16\\n 16 Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in\\nour eyes?  Yea, and who can comprehend the marvelous works of\\nGod?\\n\\nMormon 9:17\\n 17 Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by his word the\\nheaven and the earth should be; and by the power of his word man\\nwas created of the dust of the earth; and by the power of his\\nword have miracles been wrought?\\n\\nMormon 9:18\\n 18 And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not many mighty\\nmiracles?  And there were many mighty miracles wrought by the\\nhands of the apostles.\\n\\nMormon 9:19\\n 19 And if there were miracles wrought then, why has God ceased\\nto be a God of miracles and yet be an unchangeable Being?  And\\nbehold, I say unto you he changeth not; if so he would cease to\\nbe God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of miracles.\\n\\nMormon 9:20\\n 20 And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the\\nchildren of men is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and\\ndepart from the right way, and know not the God in whom they\\nshould trust.\\n\\nMormon 9:21\\n 21 Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in Christ,\\ndoubting nothing, whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name\\nof Christ it shall be granted him; and this promise is unto all,\\neven unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\nMormon 9:22\\n 22 For behold, thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his\\ndisciples who should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples,\\nin the hearing of the multitude: Go ye into all the world, and\\npreach the gospel to every creature;\\n\\nMormon 9:23\\n 23 And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he\\nthat believeth not shall be damned;\\n\\nMormon 9:24\\n 24 And these signs shall follow them that believe--in my name\\nshall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;\\nthey shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing\\nit shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they\\nshall recover;\\n\\nMormon 9:25\\n 25 And whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing,\\nunto him will I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the\\nearth.\\n\\nMormon 9:26\\n 26 And now, behold, who can stand against the works of the Lord?\\n\\nWho can deny his sayings?  Who will rise up against the almighty\\npower of the Lord?  Who will despise the works of the Lord?  Who\\nwill despise the children of Christ?

And it came to pass that the Lord did\\ngo before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud,\\nand gave directions whither they should travel.\\n\\nEther 2:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness,\\nand did build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being\\ndirected continually by the hand of the Lord.\\n\\nEther 2:7\\n 7 And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the\\nsea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth\\neven unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other\\nlands, which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people.\\n\\nEther 2:8\\n 8 And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that\\nwhoso should possess this land of promise, from that time\\nhenceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God,\\nor they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should\\ncome upon them.\\n\\nEther 2:9\\n 9 And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this\\nland, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall\\npossess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the\\nfulness of his wrath shall come upon them.  And the fulness of\\nhis wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity.\\n\\nEther 2:10\\n 10 For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other\\nlands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall\\nbe swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God.

And as they came to the sea\\nthey pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place\\nMoriancumer; and they dwelt in tents, and dwelt in tents upon the\\nseashore for the space of four years.\\n\\nEther 2:14\\n 14 And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord\\ncame again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and\\ntalked with him.  And for the space of three hours did the Lord\\ntalk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he\\nremembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.\\n\\nEther 2:15\\n 15 And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had\\ndone, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who\\nwere with him.  And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee\\nand thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more,\\nfor ye shall remember that my Spirit will not always strive with\\nman; wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall\\nbe cut off from the presence of the Lord.  And these are my\\nthoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your\\ninheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands.\\n\\nEther 2:16\\n 16 And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of\\nbarges which ye have hitherto built.  And it came to pass that\\nthe brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and\\nbuilt barges after the manner which they had built, according to\\nthe instructions of the Lord.  And they were small, and they were\\nlight upon the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon\\nthe water.\\n\\nEther 2:17\\n 17 And they were built after a manner that they were exceedingly\\ntight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the\\nbottom thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof\\nwere tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof were peaked;\\nand the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length\\nthereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it\\nwas shut, was tight like unto a dish.\\n\\nEther 2:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the\\nLord, saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast\\ncommanded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast\\ndirected me.\\n\\nEther 2:19\\n 19 And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light; whither shall\\nwe steer?  And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot\\nbreathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall\\nperish.\\n\\nEther 2:20\\n 20 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou\\nshalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when\\nthou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive\\nair.  And if it be so that the water come in upon thee, behold,\\nye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood.\\n\\nEther 2:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so,\\naccording as the Lord had commanded.\\n\\nEther 2:22\\n 22 And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I\\nhave done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the\\nvessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them. \\nBehold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great\\nwater in darkness?\\n\\nEther 2:23\\n 23 And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye\\nthat I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?  For\\nbehold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in\\npieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go\\nby the light of fire.\\n\\nEther 2:24\\n 24 For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea;\\nfor the mountain waves shall dash upon you.  Nevertheless, I will\\nbring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds\\nhave gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the\\nfloods have I sent forth.\\n\\nEther 2:25\\n 25 And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot\\ncross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the\\nsea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which\\nshall come.  Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you\\nthat ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of\\nthe sea?\\n\\nEther 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\nEther 3:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number\\nof the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto\\nthe mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its\\nexceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small\\nstones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass;\\nand he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and\\ncried again unto the Lord, saying:\\n\\nEther 3:2\\n 2 O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by\\nthe floods.  Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy\\nservant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that\\nthou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are\\nunworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become\\nevil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a\\ncommandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may\\nreceive according to our desires.\\n\\nEther 3:3\\n 3 Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity,\\nand hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been\\nin the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us.\\n\\nO Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this\\nthy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this\\nraging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have\\nmolten out of the rock.\\n\\nEther 3:4\\n 4 And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do\\nwhatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch\\nthese stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they\\nmay shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us\\nin the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light\\nwhile we shall cross the sea.\\n\\nEther 3:5\\n 5 Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this.  We know that thou art\\nable to show forth great power, which looks small unto the\\nunderstanding of men.\\n\\nEther 3:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said\\nthese words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and\\ntouched the stones one by one with his finger.  And the veil was\\ntaken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the\\nfinger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto\\nflesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the\\nLord, for he was struck with fear.\\n\\nEther 3:7\\n 7 And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the\\nearth; and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen?\\n\\nEther 3:8\\n 8 And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and\\nI feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord\\nhad flesh and blood.\\n\\nEther 3:9\\n 9 And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast\\nseen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man\\ncome before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were\\nit not so ye could not have seen my finger.  Sawest thou more\\nthan this?\\n\\nEther 3:10\\n 10 And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.\\n\\nEther 3:11\\n 11 And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words which I\\nshall speak?\\n\\nEther 3:12\\n 12 And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the\\ntruth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.\\n\\nEther 3:13\\n 13 And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord showed\\nhimself unto him, and said: Because thou knowest these things ye\\nare redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my\\npresence; therefore I show myself unto you.\\n\\nEther 3:14\\n 14 Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the\\nworld to redeem my people.  Behold, I am Jesus Christ.  I am the\\nFather and the Son.  In me shall all mankind have life, and that\\neternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall\\nbecome my sons and my daughters.\\n\\nEther 3:15\\n 15 And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created,\\nfor never has man believed in me as thou hast.  Seest thou that\\nye are created after mine own image?  Yea, even all men were\\ncreated in the beginning after mine own image.\\n\\nEther 3:16\\n 16 Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my\\nspirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and\\neven as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto\\nmy people in the flesh.\\n\\nEther 3:17\\n 17 And now, as I, Moroni, said I could not make a full account\\nof these things which are written therefore it sufficeth me to\\nsay that Jesus showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even\\nafter the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he\\nshowed himself unto the Nephites.\\n\\nEther 3:18\\n 18 And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the\\nNephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God,\\nbecause of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto\\nhim.\\n\\nEther 3:19\\n 19 And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept\\nfrom beholding within the veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus,\\nwhich, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was\\nthe finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he knew,\\nnothing doubting.\\n\\nEther 3:20\\n 20 Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not\\nbe kept from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus; and he did\\nminister unto him.\\n\\nEther 3:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of\\nJared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have\\nseen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the time cometh\\nthat I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall\\ntreasure up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it\\nto no man.\\n\\nEther 3:22\\n 22 And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye shall write them\\nand shall seal them up, that no one can interpret them; for ye\\nshall write them in a language that they cannot be read.\\n\\nEther 3:23\\n 23 And behold, these two stones will I give unto thee, and ye\\nshall seal them up also with the things which ye shall write.\\n\\nEther 3:24\\n 24 For behold, the language which ye shall write I have\\nconfounded; wherefore I will cause in my own due time that these\\nstones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye\\nshall write.\\n\\nEther 3:25\\n 25 And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the\\nbrother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been,\\nand also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his\\nsight, even unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\nEther 3:26\\n 26 For he had said unto him in times before, that if he would\\nbelieve in him that he could show unto him all things--it should\\nbe shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything\\nfrom him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things.\\n\\nEther 3:27\\n 27 And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and seal them\\nup; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children\\nof men.\\n\\nEther 3:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he\\nshould seal up the two stones which he had received, and show\\nthem not, until the Lord should show them unto the children of\\nmen.\\n\\nEther 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\nEther 4:1\\n 1 And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of\\nthe mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things\\nwhich he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the\\nchildren of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the\\ncross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they\\nshould not come unto the world until after Christ should show\\nhimself unto his people.\\n\\nEther 4:2\\n 2 And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people he\\ncommanded that they should be made manifest.\\n\\nEther 4:3\\n 3 And now, after that, they have all dwindled in unbelief; and\\nthere is none save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected\\nthe gospel of Christ; therefore I am commanded that I should hide\\nthem up again in the earth.\\n\\nEther 4:4\\n 4 Behold, I have written upon these plates the very things which\\nthe brother of Jared saw; and there never were greater things\\nmade manifest than those which were made manifest unto the\\nbrother of Jared.\\n\\nEther 4:5\\n 5 Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have\\nwritten them.  And he commanded me that I should seal them up;\\nand he also hath commanded that I should seal up the\\ninterpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the\\ninterpreters, according to the commandment of the Lord.\\n\\nEther 4:6\\n 6 For the Lord said unto me: They shall not go forth unto the\\nGentiles until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity,\\nand become clean before the Lord.\\n\\nEther 4:7\\n 7 And in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith\\nthe Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become\\nsanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the things which\\nthe brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my\\nrevelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of\\nthe heavens and of the earth, and all things that in them are.\\n\\nEther 4:8\\n 8 And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him\\nbe accursed; and he that shall deny these things, let him be\\naccursed; for unto them will I show no greater things, saith\\nJesus Christ; for I am he who speaketh.\\n\\nEther 4:9\\n 9 And at my command the heavens are opened and are shut; and at\\nmy word the earth shall shake; and at my command the inhabitants\\nthereof shall pass away, even so as by fire.\\n\\nEther 4:10\\n 10 And he that believeth not my words believeth not my\\ndisciples; and if it so be that I do not speak, judge ye; for ye\\nshall know that it is I that speaketh, at the last day.\\n\\nEther 4:11\\n 11 But he that believeth these things which I have spoken, him\\nwill I visit with the manifestations of my Spirit, and he shall\\nknow and bear record.  For because of my Spirit he shall know\\nthat these things are true; for it persuadeth men to do good.\\n\\nEther 4:12\\n 12 And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for\\ngood cometh of none save it be of me.  I am the same that leadeth\\nmen to all good; he that will not believe my words will not\\nbelieve me--that I am; and he that will not believe me will not\\nbelieve the Father who sent me.  For behold, I am the Father, I\\nam the light, and the life, and the truth of the world.\\n\\nEther 4:13\\n 13 Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will show unto you the\\ngreater things, the knowledge which is hid up because of\\nunbelief.\\n\\nEther 4:14\\n 14 Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it shall be made\\nmanifest unto you how great things the Father hath laid up for\\nyou, from the foundation of the world; and it hath not come unto\\nyou, because of unbelief.\\n\\nEther 4:15\\n 15 Behold, when ye shall rend that veil of unbelief which doth\\ncause you to remain in your awful state of wickedness, and\\nhardness of heart, and blindness of mind, then shall the great\\nand marvelous things which have been hid up from the foundation\\nof the world from you--yea, when ye shall call upon the Father in\\nmy name, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then shall ye\\nknow that the Father hath remembered the covenant which he made\\nunto your fathers, O house of Israel.\\n\\nEther 4:16\\n 16 And then shall my revelations which I have caused to be\\nwritten by my servant John be unfolded in the eyes of all the\\npeople.  Remember, when ye see these things, ye shall know that\\nthe time is at hand that they shall be made manifest in very\\ndeed.\\n\\nEther 4:17\\n 17 Therefore, when ye shall receive this record ye may know that\\nthe work of the Father has commenced upon all the face of the\\nland.\\n\\nEther 4:18\\n 18 Therefore, repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me,\\nand believe in my gospel, and be baptized in my name; for he that\\nbelieveth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth\\nnot shall be damned; and signs shall follow them that believe in\\nmy name.\\n\\nEther 4:19\\n 19 And blessed is he that is found faithful unto my name at the\\nlast day, for he shall be lifted up to dwell in the kingdom\\nprepared for him from the foundation of the world.  And behold it\\nis I that hath spoken it.  Amen.\\n\\nEther 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\nEther 5:1\\n 1 And now I, Moroni, have written the words which were commanded\\nme, according to my memory; and I have told you the things which\\nI have sealed up; therefore touch them not in order that ye may\\ntranslate; for that thing is forbidden you, except by and by it\\nshall be wisdom in God.\\n\\nEther 5:2\\n 2 And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may show the plates\\nunto those who shall assist to bring forth this work;\\n\\nEther 5:3\\n 3 And unto three shall they be shown by the power of God;\\nwherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true.\\n\\nEther 5:4\\n 4 And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be\\nestablished; and the testimony of three, and this work, in the\\nwhich shall be shown forth the power of God and also his word, of\\nwhich the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear\\nrecord--and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world\\nat the last day.\\n\\nEther 5:5\\n 5 And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in\\nthe name of Jesus, they shall be received into the kingdom of\\nGod.\\n\\nEther 5:6\\n 6 And now, if I have no authority for these things, judge ye;\\nfor ye shall know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and\\nwe shall stand before God at the last day.  Amen.\\n\\nEther 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\nEther 6:1\\n 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of Jared and his\\nbrother.\\n\\nEther 6:2\\n 2 For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones\\nwhich the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the\\nbrother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth\\nthe stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end\\nthereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.\\n\\nEther 6:3\\n 3 And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in darkness, to give\\nlight unto men, women, and children, that they might not cross\\nthe great waters in darkness.\\n\\nEther 6:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of\\nfood, that thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also\\nfood for their flocks and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal\\nor fowl that they should carry with them--and it came to pass\\nthat when they had done all these things they got aboard of their\\nvessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending\\nthemselves unto the Lord their God.\\n\\nEther 6:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should\\nbe a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the\\npromised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the\\nsea before the wind.\\n\\nEther 6:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the\\ndepths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon\\nthem, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused\\nby the fierceness of the wind.\\n\\nEther 6:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep\\nthere was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being\\ntight like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the\\nark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many\\nwaters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth\\nagain upon the top of the waters.\\n\\nEther 6:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow\\ntowards the promised land while they were upon the waters; and\\nthus they were driven forth before the wind.\\n\\nEther 6:9\\n 9 And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of\\nJared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise\\nthe Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not\\ncease to praise the Lord.\\n\\nEther 6:10\\n 10 And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea\\ncould break them, neither whale that could mar them; and they did\\nhave light continually, whether it was above the water or under\\nthe water.\\n\\nEther 6:11\\n 11 And thus they were driven forth, three hundred and forty and\\nfour days upon the water.\\n\\nEther 6:12\\n 12 And they did land upon the shore of the promised land.  And\\nwhen they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land\\nthey bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did\\nhumble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy\\nbefore the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies\\nover them.\\n\\nEther 6:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that they went forth upon the face of the\\nland, and began to till the earth.\\n\\nEther 6:14\\n 14 And Jared had four sons; and they were called Jacom, and\\nGilgah, and Mahah, and Orihah.\\n\\nEther 6:15\\n 15 And the brother of Jared also begat sons and daughters.\\n\\nEther 6:16\\n 16 And the friends of Jared and his brother were in number about\\ntwenty and two souls; and they also begat sons and daughters\\nbefore they came to the promised land; and therefore they began\\nto be many.\\n\\nEther 6:17\\n 17 And they were taught to walk humbly before the Lord; and they\\nwere also taught from on high.\\n\\nEther 6:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that they began to spread upon the face\\nof the land, and to multiply and to till the earth; and they did\\nwax strong in the land.\\n\\nEther 6:19\\n 19 And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he\\nmust soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let\\nus gather together our people that we may number them, that we\\nmay know of them what they will desire of us before we go down to\\nour graves.\\n\\nEther 6:20\\n 20 And accordingly the people were gathered together.  Now the\\nnumber of the sons and the daughters of the brother of Jared were\\ntwenty and two souls; and the number of sons and daughters of\\nJared were twelve, he having four sons.\\n\\nEther 6:21\\n 21 And it came to pass that they did number their people; and\\nafter that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the\\nthings which they would that they should do before they went down\\nto their graves.\\n\\nEther 6:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that the people desired of them that they\\nshould anoint one of their sons to be a king over them.\\n\\nEther 6:23\\n 23 And now behold, this was grievous unto them.  And the brother\\nof Jared said unto them: Surely this thing leadeth into\\ncaptivity.\\n\\nEther 6:24\\n 24 But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may\\nhave a king.  And therefore he said unto them: Choose ye out from\\namong our sons a king, even whom ye will.\\n\\nEther 6:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the\\nbrother of Jared; and his name was Pagag.  And it came to pass\\nthat he refused and would not be their king.  And the people\\nwould that his father should constrain him, but his father would\\nnot; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to\\nbe their king.\\n\\nEther 6:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that they chose all the brothers of\\nPagag, and they would not.\\n\\nEther 6:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that neither would the sons of Jared,\\neven all save it were one; and Orihah was anointed to be king\\nover the people.\\n\\nEther 6:28\\n 28 And he began to reign, and the people began to prosper; and\\nthey became exceedingly rich.\\n\\nEther 6:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that Jared died, and his brother also.\\n\\nEther 6:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that Orihah did walk humbly before the\\nLord, and did remember how great things the Lord had done for his\\nfather, and also taught his people how great things the Lord had\\ndone for their fathers.\\n\\nEther 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\nEther 7:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that Orihah did execute judgment upon the\\nland in righteousness all his days, whose days were exceedingly\\nmany.\\n\\nEther 7:2\\n 2 And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat thirty and one,\\namong whom were twenty and three sons.\\n\\nEther 7:3\\n 3 And it came to pass that he also begat Kib in his old age. \\nAnd it came to pass that Kib reigned in his stead; and Kib begat\\nCorihor.\\n\\nEther 7:4\\n 4 And when Corihor was thirty and two years old he rebelled\\nagainst his father, and went over and dwelt in the land of Nehor;\\nand he begat sons and daughters, and they became exceedingly\\nfair; wherefore Corihor drew away many people after him.\\n\\nEther 7:5\\n 5 And when he had gathered together an army he came up unto the\\nland of Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, which\\nbrought to pass the saying of the brother of Jared that they\\nwould be brought into captivity.\\n\\nEther 7:6\\n 6 Now the land of Moron, where the king dwelt, was near the land\\nwhich is called Desolation by the Nephites.\\n\\nEther 7:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in captivity, and his\\npeople under Corihor his son, until he became exceedingly old;\\nnevertheless Kib begat Shule in his old age, while he was yet in\\ncaptivity.\\n\\nEther 7:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that Shule was angry with his brother; and\\nShule waxed strong, and became mighty as to the strength of a\\nman; and he was also mighty in judgment.\\n\\nEther 7:9\\n 9 Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out\\nof the hill, and made swords out of steel for those whom he had\\ndrawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he\\nreturned to the city Nehor and gave battle unto his brother\\nCorihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and restored it\\nunto his father Kib.\\n\\nEther 7:10\\n 10 And now because of the thing which Shule had done, his father\\nbestowed upon him the kingdom; therefore he began to reign in the\\nstead of his father.\\n\\nEther 7:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that he did execute judgment in\\nrighteousness; and he did spread his kingdom upon all the face of\\nthe land, for the people had become exceedingly numerous.\\n\\nEther 7:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that Shule also begat many sons and\\ndaughters.\\n\\nEther 7:13\\n 13 And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done;\\nwherefore Shule gave him power in his kingdom.\\n\\nEther 7:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Corihor had many sons and daughters.\\n\\nAnd among the sons of Corihor there was one whose name was Noah.\\n\\nEther 7:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that Noah rebelled against Shule, the\\nking, and also his father Corihor, and drew away Cohor his\\nbrother, and also all his brethren and many of the people.\\n\\nEther 7:16\\n 16 And he gave battle unto Shule the king, in which he did\\nobtain the land of their first inheritance; and he became a king\\nover that part of the land.\\n\\nEther 7:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that he gave battle again unto Shule, the\\nking; and he took Shule, the king, and carried him away captive\\ninto Moron.\\n\\nEther 7:18\\n 18 And it came to pass as he was about to put him to death, the\\nsons of Shule crept into the house of Noah by night and slew him,\\nand broke down the door of the prison and brought out their\\nfather, and placed him upon his throne in his own kingdom.\\n\\nEther 7:19\\n 19 Wherefore, the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his\\nstead; nevertheless they did not gain power any more over Shule\\nthe king, and the people who were under the reign of Shule the\\nking did prosper exceedingly and wax great.\\n\\nEther 7:20\\n 20 And the country was divided; and there were two kingdoms, the\\nkingdom of Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, the son of Noah.\\n\\nEther 7:21\\n 21 And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should\\ngive battle unto Shule, in which Shule did beat them and did slay\\nCohor.\\n\\nEther 7:22\\n 22 And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod\\ngave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in\\nthe eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon\\nhim, and he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his\\ndesires.\\n\\nEther 7:23\\n 23 And also in the reign of Shule there came prophets among the\\npeople, who were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the\\nwickedness and idolatry of the people was bringing a curse upon\\nthe land, and they should be destroyed if they did not repent.\\n\\nEther 7:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that the people did revile against the\\nprophets, and did mock them.  And it came to pass that king Shule\\ndid execute judgment against all those who did revile against the\\nprophets.\\n\\nEther 7:25\\n 25 And he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave\\npower unto the prophets that they should go whithersoever they\\nwould; and by this cause the people were brought unto repentance.\\n\\nEther 7:26\\n 26 And because the people did repent of their iniquities and\\nidolatries the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper\\nagain in the land.  And it came to pass that Shule begat sons and\\ndaughters in his old age.\\n\\nEther 7:27\\n 27 And there were no more wars in the days of Shule; and he\\nremembered the great things that the Lord had done for his\\nfathers in bringing them across the great deep into the promised\\nland; wherefore he did execute judgment in righteousness all his\\ndays.\\n\\nEther 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\nEther 8:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer reigned in\\nhis stead.  And Omer begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and\\ndaughters.\\n\\nEther 8:2\\n 2 And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in\\nthe land of Heth.  And it came to pass that he did flatter many\\npeople, because of his cunning words, until he had gained the\\nhalf of the kingdom.\\n\\nEther 8:3\\n 3 And when he had gained the half of the kingdom he gave battle\\nunto his father, and he did carry away his father into captivity,\\nand did make him serve in captivity;\\n\\nEther 8:4\\n 4 And now, in the days of the reigns of Omer he was in captivity\\nthe half of his days.  And it came to pass that he begat sons and\\ndaughters among whom were Esrom and Coriantumr;\\n\\nEther 8:5\\n 5 And they were exceedingly angry because of the doings of Jared\\ntheir brother, insomuch that they did raise an army and gave\\nbattle unto Jared.  And it came to pass that they did give battle\\nunto him by night.\\n\\nEther 8:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that when they had slain the army of Jared\\nthey were about to slay him also; and he plead with them that\\nthey would not slay him, and he would give up the kingdom unto\\nhis father.  And it came to pass that they did grant unto him his\\nlife.\\n\\nEther 8:7\\n 7 And now Jared became exceedingly sorrowful because of the loss\\nof the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom and\\nupon the glory of the world.\\n\\nEther 8:8\\n 8 Now the daughter of Jared being exceedingly expert, and seeing\\nthe sorrows of her father, thought to devise a plan whereby she\\ncould redeem the kingdom unto her father.\\n\\nEther 8:9\\n 9 Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair.  And it came\\nto pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him:\\nWhereby hath my father so much sorrow?  Hath he not read the\\nrecord which our fathers brought across the great deep?  Behold,\\nis there not an account concerning them of old, that they by\\ntheir secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?\\n\\nEther 8:10\\n 10 And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of\\nKimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I\\nwill please him, that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he\\nshall desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then\\nshall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head\\nof my father, the king.\\n\\nEther 8:11\\n 11 And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore, when Jared had\\nsent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him that she\\npleased him, insomuch that he desired her to wife.  And it came\\nto pass that he said unto Jared: Give her unto me to wife.\\n\\nEther 8:12\\n 12 And Jared said unto him: I will give her unto you, if ye will\\nbring unto me the head of my father, the king.\\n\\nEther 8:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that Akish gathered in unto the house of\\nJared all his kinsfolk, and said unto them: Will ye swear unto me\\nthat ye will be faithful unto me in the thing which I shall\\ndesire of you?\\n\\nEther 8:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God\\nof heaven, and also by the heavens, and also by the earth, and by\\ntheir heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance which\\nAkish desired should lose his head; and whoso should divulge\\nwhatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same should lose\\nhis life.\\n\\nEther 8:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish.  And\\nAkish did administer unto them the oaths which were given by them\\nof old who also sought power, which had been handed down even\\nfrom Cain, who was a murderer from the beginning.\\n\\nEther 8:16\\n 16 And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer\\nthese oaths unto the people, to keep them in darkness, to help\\nsuch as sought power to gain power, and to murder, and to\\nplunder, and to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and\\nwhoredoms.\\n\\nEther 8:17\\n 17 And it was the daughter of Jared who put it into his heart to\\nsearch up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart of\\nAkish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and\\nfriends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatsoever\\nthing he desired.\\n\\nEther 8:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that they formed a secret combination,\\neven as they of old; which combination is most abominable and\\nwicked above all, in the sight of God;\\n\\nEther 8:19\\n 19 For the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth\\nhe will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath\\nforbidden it, from the beginning of man.\\n\\nEther 8:20\\n 20 And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and\\ncombinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are\\nhad among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites.\\n\\nEther 8:21\\n 21 And they have caused the destruction of this people of whom I\\nam now speaking, and also the destruction of the people of Nephi.\\n\\nEther 8:22\\n 22 And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations,\\nto get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation,\\nbehold, they shall be destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer\\nthat the blood of his saints, which shall be shed by them, shall\\nalways cry unto him from the ground for vengeance upon them and\\nyet he avenge them not.\\n\\nEther 8:23\\n 23 Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these\\nthings should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of\\nyour sins, and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall\\nget above you, which are built up to get power and gain--and the\\nwork, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you, yea, even\\nthe sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you,\\nto your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things\\nto be.\\n\\nEther 8:24\\n 24 Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these\\nthings come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your\\nawful situation, because of this secret combination which shall\\nbe among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who\\nhave been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon\\nit, and also upon those who built it up.\\n\\nEther 8:25\\n 25 For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to\\noverthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and\\nit bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is\\nbuilt up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that\\nsame liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same\\nliar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who\\nhath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the\\nprophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning.\\n\\nEther 8:26\\n 26 Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that\\nevil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may\\nhave no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that\\nthey may be persuaded to do good continually, that they may come\\nunto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved.\\n\\nEther 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\nEther 9:1\\n 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record.  Therefore, behold,\\nit came to pass that because of the secret combinations of Akish\\nand his friends, behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer.\\n\\nEther 9:2\\n 2 Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful unto Omer, and also to his\\nsons and to his daughters who did not seek his destruction.\\n\\nEther 9:3\\n 3 And the Lord warned Omer in a dream that he should depart out\\nof the land; wherefore Omer departed out of the land with his\\nfamily, and traveled many days, and came over and passed by the\\nhill of Shim, and came over by the place where the Nephites were\\ndestroyed, and from thence eastward, and came to a place which\\nwas called Ablom, by the seashore, and there he pitched his tent,\\nand also his sons and his daughters, and all his household, save\\nit were Jared and his family.\\n\\nEther 9:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that Jared was anointed king over the\\npeople, by the hand of wickedness; and he gave unto Akish his\\ndaughter to wife.\\n\\nEther 9:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that Akish sought the life of his\\nfather-in-law; and he applied unto those whom he had sworn by the\\noath of the ancients, and they obtained the head of his\\nfather-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his\\npeople.\\n\\nEther 9:6\\n 6 For so great had been the spreading of this wicked and secret\\nsociety that it had corrupted the hearts of all the people;\\ntherefore Jared was murdered upon his throne, and Akish reigned\\nin his stead.\\n\\nEther 9:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that Akish began to be jealous of his son,\\ntherefore he shut him up in prison, and kept him upon little or\\nno food until he had suffered death.\\n\\nEther 9:8\\n 8 And now the brother of him that suffered death, (and his name\\nwas Nimrah) was angry with his father because of that which his\\nfather had done unto his brother.\\n\\nEther 9:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that Nimrah gathered together a small\\nnumber of men, and fled out of the land, and came over and dwelt\\nwith Omer.\\n\\nEther 9:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that Akish begat other sons, and they won\\nthe hearts of the people, notwithstanding they had sworn unto him\\nto do all manner of iniquity according to that which he desired.\\n\\nEther 9:11\\n 11 Now the people of Akish were desirous for gain, even as Akish\\nwas desirous for power; wherefore, the sons of Akish did offer\\nthem money, by which means they drew away the more part of the\\npeople after them.\\n\\nEther 9:12\\n 12 And there began to be a war between the sons of Akish and\\nAkish, which lasted for the space of many years, yea, unto the\\ndestruction of nearly all the people of the kingdom, yea, even\\nall, save it were thirty souls, and they who fled with the house\\nof Omer.\\n\\nEther 9:13\\n 13 Wherefore, Omer was restored again to the land of his\\ninheritance.\\n\\nEther 9:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Omer began to be old; nevertheless,\\nin his old age he begat Emer; and he anointed Emer to be king to\\nreign in his stead.\\n\\nEther 9:15\\n 15 And after that he had anointed Emer to be king he saw peace\\nin the land for the space of two years, and he died, having seen\\nexceedingly many days, which were full of sorrow.  And it came to\\npass that Emer did reign in his stead, and did fill the steps of\\nhis father.\\n\\nEther 9:16\\n 16 And the Lord began again to take the curse from off the land,\\nand the house of Emer did prosper exceedingly under the reign of\\nEmer; and in the space of sixty and two years they had become\\nexceedingly strong, insomuch that they became exceedingly rich--\\n\\nEther 9:17\\n 17 Having all manner of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and\\nof fine linen, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious\\nthings;\\n\\nEther 9:18\\n 18 And also all manner of cattle, of oxen, and cows, and of\\nsheep, and of swine, and of goats, and also many other kinds of\\nanimals which were useful for the food of man.\\n\\nEther 9:19\\n 19 And they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants\\nand cureloms and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and\\nmore especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms.\\n\\nEther 9:20\\n 20 And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land,\\nwhich was choice above all other lands; and he commanded that\\nwhoso should possess the land should possess it unto the Lord, or\\nthey should be destroyed when they were ripened in iniquity; for\\nupon such, saith the Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my\\nwrath.\\n\\nEther 9:21\\n 21 And Emer did execute judgment in righteousness all his days,\\nand he begat many sons and daughters; and he begat Coriantum, and\\nhe anointed Coriantum to reign in his stead.\\n\\nEther 9:22\\n 22 And after he had anointed Coriantum to reign in his stead he\\nlived four years, and he saw peace in the land; yea, and he even\\nsaw the Son of Righteousness, and did rejoice and glory in his\\nday; and he died in peace.\\n\\nEther 9:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that Coriantum did walk in the steps of\\nhis father, and did build many mighty cities, and did administer\\nthat which was good unto his people in all his days.  And it came\\nto pass that he had no children even until he was exceedingly\\nold.\\n\\nEther 9:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that his wife died, being an hundred and\\ntwo years old.  And it came to pass that Coriantum took to wife,\\nin his old age, a young maid, and begat sons and daughters;\\nwherefore he lived until he was an hundred and forty and two\\nyears old.\\n\\nEther 9:25\\n 25 And it came to pass that he begat Com, and Com reigned in his\\nstead; and he reigned forty and nine years, and he begat Heth;\\nand he also begat other sons and daughters.\\n\\nEther 9:26\\n 26 And the people had spread again over all the face of the\\nland, and there began again to be an exceedingly great wickedness\\nupon the face of the land, and Heth began to embrace the secret\\nplans again of old, to destroy his father.\\n\\nEther 9:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that he did dethrone his father, for he\\nslew him with his own sword; and he did reign in his stead.\\n\\nEther 9:28\\n 28 And there came prophets in the land again, crying repentance\\nunto them--that they must prepare the way of the Lord or there\\nshould come a curse upon the face of the land; yea, even there\\nshould be a great famine, in which they should be destroyed if\\nthey did not repent.\\n\\nEther 9:29\\n 29 But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but\\nthey cast them out; and some of them they cast into pits and left\\nthem to perish.  And it came to pass that they did all these\\nthings according to the commandment of the king, Heth.\\n\\nEther 9:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that there began to be a great dearth\\nupon the land, and the inhabitants began to be destroyed\\nexceedingly fast because of the dearth, for there was no rain\\nupon the face of the earth.\\n\\nEther 9:31\\n 31 And there came forth poisonous serpents also upon the face of\\nthe land, and did poison many people.  And it came to pass that\\ntheir flocks began to flee before the poisonous serpents, towards\\nthe land southward, which was called by the Nephites Zarahemla.\\n\\nEther 9:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that there were many of them which did\\nperish by the way; nevertheless, there were some which fled into\\nthe land southward.\\n\\nEther 9:33\\n 33 And it came to pass that the Lord did cause the serpents that\\nthey should pursue them no more, but that they should hedge up\\nthe way that the people could not pass, that whoso should attempt\\nto pass might fall by the poisonous serpents.\\n\\nEther 9:34\\n 34 And it came to pass that the people did follow the course of\\nthe beasts, and did devour the carcasses of them which fell by\\nthe way, until they had devoured them all.  Now when the people\\nsaw that they must perish they began to repent of their\\niniquities and cry unto the Lord.\\n\\nEther 9:35\\n 35 And it came to pass that when they had humbled themselves\\nsufficiently before the Lord he did send rain upon the face of\\nthe earth; and the people began to revive again, and there began\\nto be fruit in the north countries, and in all the countries\\nround about.  And the Lord did show forth his power unto them in\\npreserving them from famine.\\n\\nEther 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\nEther 10:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that Shez, who was a descendant of\\nHeth--for Heth had perished by the famine, and all his household\\nsave it were Shez--wherefore, Shez began to build up again a\\nbroken people.\\n\\nEther 10:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of\\nhis fathers, and he did build up a righteous kingdom; for he\\nremembered what the Lord had done in bringing Jared and his\\nbrother across the deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord;\\nand he begat sons and daughters.\\n\\nEther 10:3\\n 3 And his eldest son, whose name was Shez, did rebel against\\nhim; nevertheless, Shez was smitten by the hand of a robber,\\nbecause of his exceeding riches, which brought peace again unto\\nhis father.\\n\\nEther 10:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that his father did build up many cities\\nupon the face of the land, and the people began again to spread\\nover all the face of the land.  And Shez did live to an\\nexceedingly old age; and he begat Riplakish.  And he died, and\\nRiplakish reigned in his stead.\\n\\nEther 10:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was\\nright in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and\\nconcubines, and did lay that upon men's shoulders which was\\ngrievous to be borne; yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes; and\\nwith the taxes he did build many spacious buildings.\\n\\nEther 10:6\\n 6 And he did erect him an exceedingly beautiful throne; and he\\ndid build many prisons, and whoso would not be subject unto taxes\\nhe did cast into prison; and whoso was not able to pay taxes he\\ndid cast into prison; and he did cause that they should labor\\ncontinually for their support; and whoso refused to labor he did\\ncause to be put to death.\\n\\nEther 10:7\\n 7 Wherefore he did obtain all his fine work, yea, even his fine\\ngold he did cause to be refined in prison, and all manner of fine\\nworkmanship he did cause to be wrought in prison.  And it came to\\npass that he did afflict the people with his whoredoms and\\nabominations.\\n\\nEther 10:8\\n 8 And when he had reigned for the space of forty and two years\\nthe people did rise up in rebellion against him; and there began\\nto be war again in the land, insomuch that Riplakish was killed,\\nand his descendants were driven out of the land.\\n\\nEther 10:9\\n 9 And it came to pass after the space of many years, Morianton,\\n(he being a descendant of Riplakish) gathered together an army of\\noutcasts, and went forth and gave battle unto the people; and he\\ngained power over many cities; and the war became exceedingly\\nsore, and did last for the space of many years; and he did gain\\npower over all the land, and did establish himself king over all\\nthe land.\\n\\nEther 10:10\\n 10 And after that he had established himself king he did ease\\nthe burden of the people, by which he did gain favor in the eyes\\nof the people, and they did anoint him to be their king.\\n\\nEther 10:11\\n 11 And he did do justice unto the people, but not unto himself\\nbecause of his many whoredoms; wherefore he was cut off from the\\npresence of the Lord.\\n\\nEther 10:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that Morianton built up many cities, and\\nthe people became exceedingly rich under his reign, both in\\nbuildings, and in gold and silver, and in raising grain, and in\\nflocks, and herds, and such things which had been restored unto\\nthem.\\n\\nEther 10:13\\n 13 And Morianton did live to an exceedingly great age, and then\\nhe begat Kim; and Kim did reign in the stead of his father; and\\nhe did reign eight years, and his father died.  And it came to\\npass that Kim did not reign in righteousness, wherefore he was\\nnot favored of the Lord.\\n\\nEther 10:14\\n 14 And his brother did rise up in rebellion against him, by\\nwhich he did bring him into captivity; and he did remain in\\ncaptivity all his days; and he begat sons and daughters in\\ncaptivity, and in his old age he begat Levi; and he died.\\n\\nEther 10:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that Levi did serve in captivity after\\nthe death of his father, for the space of forty and two years. \\nAnd he did make war against the king of the land, by which he did\\nobtain unto himself the kingdom.\\n\\nEther 10:16\\n 16 And after he had obtained unto himself the kingdom he did\\nthat which was right in the sight of the Lord; and the people did\\nprosper in the land; and he did live to a good old age, and begat\\nsons and daughters; and he also begat Corom, whom he anointed\\nking in his stead.\\n\\nEther 10:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that Corom did that which was good in the\\nsight of the Lord all his days; and he begat many sons and\\ndaughters; and after he had seen many days he did pass away, even\\nlike unto the rest of the earth; and Kish reigned in his stead.\\n\\nEther 10:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Kish passed away also, and Lib\\nreigned in his stead.\\n\\nEther 10:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in\\nthe sight of the Lord.  And in the days of Lib the poisonous\\nserpents were destroyed.  Wherefore they did go into the land\\nsouthward, to hunt food for the people of the land, for the land\\nwas covered with animals of the forest.  And Lib also himself\\nbecame a great hunter.\\n\\nEther 10:20\\n 20 And they built a great city by the narrow neck of land, by\\nthe place where the sea divides the land.\\n\\nEther 10:21\\n 21 And they did preserve the land southward for a wilderness, to\\nget game.  And the whole face of the land northward was covered\\nwith inhabitants.\\n\\nEther 10:22\\n 22 And they were exceedingly industrious, and they did buy and\\nsell and traffic one with another, that they might get gain.\\n\\nEther 10:23\\n 23 And they did work in all manner of ore, and they did make\\ngold, and silver, and iron, and brass, and all manner of metals;\\nand they did dig it out of the earth; wherefore they did cast up\\nmighty heaps of earth to get ore, of gold, and of silver, and of\\niron, and of copper.  And they did work all manner of fine work.\\n\\nEther 10:24\\n 24 And they did have silks, and fine-twined linen; and they did\\nwork all manner of cloth, that they might clothe themselves from\\ntheir nakedness.\\n\\nEther 10:25\\n 25 And they did make all manner of tools to till the earth, both\\nto plow and to sow, to reap and to hoe, and also to thrash.\\n\\nEther 10:26\\n 26 And they did make all manner of tools with which they did\\nwork their beasts.\\n\\nEther 10:27\\n 27 And they did make all manner of weapons of war.  And they did\\nwork all manner of work of exceedingly curious workmanship.\\n\\nEther 10:28\\n 28 And never could be a people more blessed than were they, and\\nmore prospered by the hand of the Lord.  And they were in a land\\nthat was choice above all lands, for the Lord had spoken it.\\n\\nEther 10:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that Lib did live many years, and begat\\nsons and daughters; and he also begat Hearthom.\\n\\nEther 10:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that Hearthom reigned in the stead of his\\nfather.  And when Hearthom had reigned twenty and four years,\\nbehold, the kingdom was taken away from him.  And he served many\\nyears in captivity, yea, even all the remainder of his days.\\n\\nEther 10:31\\n 31 And he begat Heth, and Heth lived in captivity all his days. \\nAnd Heth begat Aaron, and Aaron dwelt in captivity all his days;\\nand he begat Amnigaddah, and Amnigaddah also dwelt in captivity\\nall his days; and he begat Coriantum, and Coriantum dwelt in\\ncaptivity all his days; and he begat Com.\\n\\nEther 10:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that Com drew away the half of the\\nkingdom.  And he reigned over the half of the kingdom forty and\\ntwo years; and he went to battle against the king, Amgid, and\\nthey fought for the space of many years, during which time Com\\ngained power over Amgid, and obtained power over the remainder of\\nthe kingdom.\\n\\nEther 10:33\\n 33 And in the days of Com there began to be robbers in the land;\\nand they adopted the old plans, and administered oaths after the\\nmanner of the ancients, and sought again to destroy the kingdom.\\n\\nEther 10:34\\n 34 Now Com did fight against them much; nevertheless, he did not\\nprevail against them.\\n\\nEther 11\\nChapter 11\\n\\nEther 11:1\\n 1 And there came also in the days of Com many prophets, and\\nprophesied of the destruction of that great people except they\\nshould repent, and turn unto the Lord, and forsake their murders\\nand wickedness.\\n\\nEther 11:2\\n 2 And it came to pass that the prophets were rejected by the\\npeople, and they fled unto Com for protection, for the people\\nsought to destroy them.\\n\\nEther 11:3\\n 3 And they prophesied unto Com many things; and he was blessed\\nin all the remainder of his days.\\n\\nEther 11:4\\n 4 And he lived to a good old age, and begat Shiblom; and Shiblom\\nreigned in his stead.  And the brother of Shiblom rebelled\\nagainst him, and there began to be an exceedingly great war in\\nall the land.\\n\\nEther 11:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that the brother of Shiblom caused that\\nall the prophets who prophesied of the destruction of the people\\nshould be put to death;\\n\\nEther 11:6\\n 6 And there was great calamity in all the land, for they had\\ntestified that a great curse should come upon the land, and also\\nupon the people, and that there should be a great destruction\\namong them, such an one as never had been upon the face of the\\nearth, and their bones should become as heaps of earth upon the\\nface of the land except they should repent of their wickedness.\\n\\nEther 11:7\\n 7 And they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, because of\\ntheir wicked combinations; wherefore, there began to be wars and\\ncontentions in all the land, and also many famines and\\npestilences, insomuch that there was a great destruction, such an\\none as never had been known upon the face of the earth; and all\\nthis came to pass in the days of Shiblom.\\n\\nEther 11:8\\n 8 And the people began to repent of their iniquity; and inasmuch\\nas they did the Lord did have mercy on them.\\n\\nEther 11:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that Shiblom was slain, and Seth was\\nbrought into captivity, and did dwell in captivity all his days.\\n\\nEther 11:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that Ahah, his son, did obtain the\\nkingdom; and he did reign over the people all his days.  And he\\ndid do all manner of iniquity in his days, by which he did cause\\nthe shedding of much blood; and few were his days.\\n\\nEther 11:11\\n 11 And Ethem, being a descendant of Ahah, did obtain the\\nkingdom; and he also did do that which was wicked in his days.\\n\\nEther 11:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that in the days of Ethem there came many\\nprophets, and prophesied again unto the people; yea, they did\\nprophesy that the Lord would utterly destroy them from off the\\nface of the earth except they repented of their iniquities.\\n\\nEther 11:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that the people hardened their hearts,\\nand would not hearken unto their words; and the prophets mourned\\nand withdrew from among the people.\\n\\nEther 11:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Ethem did execute judgment in\\nwickedness all his days; and he begat Moron.  And it came to pass\\nthat Moron did reign in his stead; and Moron did that which was\\nwicked before the Lord.\\n\\nEther 11:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that there arose a rebellion among the\\npeople, because of that secret combination which was built up to\\nget power and gain; and there arose a mighty man among them in\\niniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in which he did overthrow\\nthe half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half of the\\nkingdom for many years.\\n\\nEther 11:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that Moron did overthrow him, and did\\nobtain the kingdom again.\\n\\nEther 11:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that there arose another mighty man; and\\nhe was a descendant of the brother of Jared.\\n\\nEther 11:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that he did overthrow Moron and obtain\\nthe kingdom; wherefore, Moron dwelt in captivity all the\\nremainder of his days; and he begat Coriantor.\\n\\nEther 11:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that Coriantor dwelt in captivity all his\\ndays.\\n\\nEther 11:20\\n 20 And in the days of Coriantor there also came many prophets,\\nand prophesied of great and marvelous things, and cried\\nrepentance unto the people, and except they should repent the\\nLord God would execute judgment against them to their utter\\ndestruction;\\n\\nEther 11:21\\n 21 And that the Lord God would send or bring forth another\\npeople to possess the land, by his power, after the manner by\\nwhich he brought their fathers.\\n\\nEther 11:22\\n 22 And they did reject all the words of the prophets, because of\\ntheir secret society and wicked abominations.\\n\\nEther 11:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that Coriantor begat Ether, and he died,\\nhaving dwelt in captivity all his days.\\n\\nEther 12\\nChapter 12\\n\\nEther 12:1\\n 1 And it came to pass that the days of Ether were in the days of\\nCoriantumr; and Coriantumr was king over all the land.\\n\\nEther 12:2\\n 2 And Ether was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore Ether came\\nforth in the days of Coriantumr, and began to prophesy unto the\\npeople, for he could not be restrained because of the Spirit of\\nthe Lord which was in him.\\n\\nEther 12:3\\n 3 For he did cry from the morning, even until the going down of\\nthe sun, exhorting the people to believe in God unto repentance\\nlest they should be destroyed, saying unto them that by faith all\\nthings are fulfilled--\\n\\nEther 12:4\\n 4 Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a\\nbetter world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which\\nhope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which\\nwould make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good\\nworks, being led to glorify God.\\n\\nEther 12:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that Ether did prophesy great and\\nmarvelous things unto the people, which they did not believe,\\nbecause they saw them not.\\n\\nEther 12:6\\n 6 And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these\\nthings; I would show unto the world that faith is things which\\nare hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see\\nnot, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your\\nfaith.\\n\\nEther 12:7\\n 7 For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our\\nfathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed not\\nhimself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore,\\nit must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed\\nhimself not unto the world.\\n\\nEther 12:8\\n 8 But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the\\nworld, and glorified the name of the Father, and prepared a way\\nthat thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that\\nthey might hope for those things which they have not seen.\\n\\nEther 12:9\\n 9 Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the\\ngift, if ye will but have faith.\\n\\nEther 12:10\\n 10 Behold it was by faith that they of old were called after the\\nholy order of God.\\n\\nEther 12:11\\n 11 Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given.  But in the\\ngift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way; and it is\\nby faith that it hath been fulfilled.\\n\\nEther 12:12\\n 12 For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do\\nno miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until\\nafter their faith.\\n\\nEther 12:13\\n 13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the\\nprison to tumble to the earth.\\n\\nEther 12:14\\n 14 Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the\\nchange upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire and\\nwith the Holy Ghost.\\n\\nEther 12:15\\n 15 Behold, it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which\\nwrought so great a miracle among the Lamanites.\\n\\nEther 12:16\\n 16 Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by\\nfaith, even those who were before Christ and also those who were\\nafter.\\n\\nEther 12:17\\n 17 And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a\\npromise that they should not taste of death; and they obtained\\nnot the promise until after their faith.\\n\\nEther 12:18\\n 18 And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after\\ntheir faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.\\n\\nEther 12:19\\n 19 And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong,\\neven before Christ came, who could not be kept from within the\\nveil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had\\nbeheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad.\\n\\nEther 12:20\\n 20 And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was\\nthe brother of Jared; for so great was his faith in God, that\\nwhen God put forth his finger he could not hide it from the sight\\nof the brother of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken\\nunto him, which word he had obtained by faith.\\n\\nEther 12:21\\n 21 And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the\\nLord, because of the promise which the brother of Jared had\\nobtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his\\nsight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer\\nbe kept without the veil.\\n\\nEther 12:22\\n 22 And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the promise\\nthat these things should come unto their brethren through the\\nGentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus\\nChrist.\\n\\nEther 12:23\\n 23 And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these\\nthings, because of our weakness in writing; for Lord thou hast\\nmade us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty\\nin writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could\\nspeak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them;\\n\\nEther 12:24\\n 24 And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because\\nof the awkwardness of our hands.  Behold, thou hast not made us\\nmighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest\\nhim that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art,\\nunto the overpowering of man to read them.\\n\\nEther 12:25\\n 25 Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that\\nwe cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our\\nweakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I\\nfear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words.\\n\\nEther 12:26\\n 26 And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying:\\nFools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for\\nthe meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness;\\n\\nEther 12:27\\n 27 And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness.\\n\\nI give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is\\nsufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if\\nthey humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will\\nI make weak things become strong unto them.\\n\\nEther 12:28\\n 28 Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness and I\\nwill show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto\\nme--the fountain of all righteousness.\\n\\nEther 12:29\\n 29 And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was comforted, and\\nsaid: O Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou\\nworkest unto the children of men according to their faith;\\n\\nEther 12:30\\n 30 For the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin,\\nRemove--and it was removed.  And if he had not had faith it would\\nnot have moved; wherefore thou workest after men have faith.\\n\\nEther 12:31\\n 31 For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for\\nafter they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show\\nthyself unto them in great power.\\n\\nEther 12:32\\n 32 And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast\\nprepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy\\nFather, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore\\nman must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place\\nwhich thou hast prepared.\\n\\nEther 12:33\\n 33 And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast\\nloved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the\\nworld, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for\\nthe children of men.\\n\\nEther 12:34\\n 34 And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the\\nchildren of men is charity; wherefore, except men shall have\\ncharity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared\\nin the mansions of thy Father.\\n\\nEther 12:35\\n 35 Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if\\nthe Gentiles have not charity, because of our weakness, that thou\\nwilt prove them, and take away their talent, yea, even that which\\nthey have received, and give unto them who shall have more\\nabundantly.\\n\\nEther 12:36\\n 36 And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would\\ngive unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity.\\n\\nEther 12:37\\n 37 And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have\\nnot charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful;\\nwherefore, thy garments shall be made clean.  And because thou\\nhast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the\\nsitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions\\nof my Father.\\n\\nEther 12:38\\n 38 And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and\\nalso unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the\\njudgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my\\ngarments are not spotted with your blood.\\n\\nEther 12:39\\n 39 And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he\\nhath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain\\nhumility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language,\\nconcerning these things;\\n\\nEther 12:40\\n 40 And only a few have I written, because of my weakness in\\nwriting.\\n\\nEther 12:41\\n 41 And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the\\nprophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the\\nFather, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which\\nbeareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever.  Amen.\\n\\nEther 13\\nChapter 13\\n\\nEther 13:1\\n 1 And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the\\ndestruction of the people of whom I have been writing.\\n\\nEther 13:2\\n 2 For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly\\ntold them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that\\nafter the waters had receded from off the face of this land it\\nbecame a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the\\nLord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him\\nwho dwell upon the face thereof;\\n\\nEther 13:3\\n 3 And that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should\\ncome down out of heaven, and the holy sanctuary of the Lord.\\n\\nEther 13:4\\n 4 Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning\\na New Jerusalem upon this land.\\n\\nEther 13:5\\n 5 And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the\\nJerusalem from whence Lehi should come--after it should be\\ndestroyed it should be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord;\\nwherefore, it could not be a new Jerusalem for it had been in a\\ntime of old; but it should be built up again, and become a holy\\ncity of the Lord; and it should be built unto the house of\\nIsrael.\\n\\nEther 13:6\\n 6 And that a New Jerusalem should be built upon this land, unto\\nthe remnant of the seed of Joseph, for which things there has\\nbeen a type.\\n\\nEther 13:7\\n 7 For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt,\\neven so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of\\nthe seed of Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be\\nmerciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should perish not,\\neven as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should\\nperish not.\\n\\nEther 13:8\\n 8 Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built\\nupon this land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and\\nthey shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the\\nJerusalem of old; and they shall no more be confounded, until the\\nend come when the earth shall pass away.\\n\\nEther 13:9\\n 9 And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they\\nshall be like unto the old save the old have passed away, and all\\nthings have become new.\\n\\nEther 13:10\\n 10 And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who\\ndwell therein, for it is they whose garments are white through\\nthe blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among\\nthe remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of\\nIsrael.\\n\\nEther 13:11\\n 11 And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the\\ninhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed\\nin the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered\\nand gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and from the\\nnorth countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the\\ncovenant which God made with their father, Abraham.\\n\\nEther 13:12\\n 12 And when these things come, bringeth to pass the scripture\\nwhich saith, there are they who were first, who shall be last;\\nand there are they who were last, who shall be first.\\n\\nEther 13:13\\n 13 And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great\\nand marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him\\nas naught, and cast him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of\\na rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the things\\nwhich should come upon the people.\\n\\nEther 13:14\\n 14 And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made the remainder\\nof his record, viewing the destructions which came upon the\\npeople, by night.\\n\\nEther 13:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that in that same year in which he was\\ncast out from among the people there began to be a great war\\namong the people, for there were many who rose up, who were\\nmighty men, and sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret\\nplans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken.\\n\\nEther 13:16\\n 16 And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in all the arts\\nof war and all the cunning of the world, wherefore he gave battle\\nunto them who sought to destroy him.\\n\\nEther 13:17\\n 17 But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters;\\nneither the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the fair\\nsons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there were none of\\nthe fair sons and daughters upon the face of the whole earth who\\nrepented of their sins.\\n\\nEther 13:18\\n 18 Wherefore, it came to pass that in the first year that Ether\\ndwelt in the cavity of a rock, there were many people who were\\nslain by the sword of those secret combinations, fighting against\\nCoriantumr that they might obtain the kingdom.\\n\\nEther 13:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the sons of Coriantumr fought much\\nand bled much.\\n\\nEther 13:20\\n 20 And in the second year the word of the Lord came to Ether,\\nthat he should go and prophesy unto Coriantumr that, if he would\\nrepent, and all his household, the Lord would give unto him his\\nkingdom and spare the people--\\n\\nEther 13:21\\n 21 Otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household\\nsave it were himself.  And he should only live to see the\\nfulfilling of the prophecies which had been spoken concerning\\nanother people receiving the land for their inheritance; and\\nCoriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul should\\nbe destroyed save it were Coriantumr.\\n\\nEther 13:22\\n 22 And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his\\nhousehold, neither the people; and the wars ceased not; and they\\nsought to kill Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again\\nin the cavity of the rock.\\n\\nEther 13:23\\n 23 And it came to pass that there arose up Shared, and he also\\ngave battle unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him, insomuch that\\nin the third year he did bring him into captivity.\\n\\nEther 13:24\\n 24 And the sons of Coriantumr, in the fourth year, did beat\\nShared, and did obtain the kingdom again unto their father.\\n\\nEther 13:25\\n 25 Now there began to be a war upon all the face of the land,\\nevery man with his band fighting for that which he desired.\\n\\nEther 13:26\\n 26 And there were robbers, and in fine, all manner of wickedness\\nupon all the face of the land.\\n\\nEther 13:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that Coriantumr was exceedingly angry\\nwith Shared, and he went against him with his armies to battle;\\nand they did meet in great anger, and they did meet in the valley\\nof Gilgal; and the battle became exceedingly sore.\\n\\nEther 13:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that Shared fought against him for the\\nspace of three days.  And it came to pass that Coriantumr beat\\nhim, and did pursue him until he came to the plains of Heshlon.\\n\\nEther 13:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that Shared gave him battle again upon\\nthe plains; and behold, he did beat Coriantumr, and drove him\\nback again to the valley of Gilgal.\\n\\nEther 13:30\\n 30 And Coriantumr gave Shared battle again in the valley of\\nGilgal, in which he beat Shared and slew him.\\n\\nEther 13:31\\n 31 And Shared wounded Coriantumr in his thigh, that he did not\\ngo to battle again for the space of two years, in which time all\\nthe people upon the face of the land were shedding blood, and\\nthere was none to restrain them.\\n\\nEther 14\\nChapter 14\\n\\nEther 14:1\\n 1 And now there began to be a great curse upon all the land\\nbecause of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man should\\nlay his tool or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place\\nwhither he would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not\\nfind it, so great was the curse upon the land.\\n\\nEther 14:2\\n 2 Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own,\\nwith his hands, and would not borrow neither would he lend; and\\nevery man kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the\\ndefence of his property and his own life and of his wives and\\nchildren.\\n\\nEther 14:3\\n 3 And now, after the space of two years, and after the death of\\nShared, behold, there arose the brother of Shared and he gave\\nbattle unto Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr did beat him and did\\npursue him to the wilderness of Akish.\\n\\nEther 14:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that the brother of Shared did give battle\\nunto him in the wilderness of Akish; and the battle became\\nexceedingly sore, and many thousands fell by the sword.\\n\\nEther 14:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that Coriantumr did lay siege to the\\nwilderness; and the brother of Shared did march forth out of the\\nwilderness by night, and slew a part of the army of Coriantumr,\\nas they were drunken.\\n\\nEther 14:6\\n 6 And he came forth to the land of Moron, and placed himself\\nupon the throne of Coriantumr.\\n\\nEther 14:7\\n 7 And it came to pass that Coriantumr dwelt with his army in the\\nwilderness for the space of two years, in which he did receive\\ngreat strength to his army.\\n\\nEther 14:8\\n 8 Now the brother of Shared, whose name was Gilead, also\\nreceived great strength to his army, because of secret\\ncombinations.\\n\\nEther 14:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that his high priest murdered him as he\\nsat upon his throne.\\n\\nEther 14:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that one of the secret combinations\\nmurdered him in a secret pass, and obtained unto himself the\\nkingdom; and his name was Lib; and Lib was a man of great\\nstature, more than any other man among all the people.\\n\\nEther 14:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that in the first year of Lib, Coriantumr\\ncame up unto the land of Moron, and gave battle unto Lib.\\n\\nEther 14:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that he fought with Lib, in which Lib did\\nsmite upon his arm that he was wounded; nevertheless, the army of\\nCoriantumr did press forward upon Lib, that he fled to the\\nborders upon the seashore.\\n\\nEther 14:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that Coriantumr pursued him; and Lib gave\\nbattle unto him upon the seashore.\\n\\nEther 14:14\\n 14 And it came to pass that Lib did smite the army of\\nCoriantumr, that they fled again to the wilderness of Akish.\\n\\nEther 14:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that Lib did pursue him until he came to\\nthe plains of Agosh.  And Coriantumr had taken all the people\\nwith him as he fled before Lib in that quarter of the land\\nwhither he fled.\\n\\nEther 14:16\\n 16 And when he had come to the plains of Agosh he gave battle\\nunto Lib, and he smote upon him until he died; nevertheless, the\\nbrother of Lib did come against Coriantumr in the stead thereof,\\nand the battle became exceedingly sore, in the which Coriantumr\\nfled again before the army of the brother of Lib.\\n\\nEther 14:17\\n 17 Now the name of the brother of Lib was called Shiz.  And it\\ncame to pass that Shiz pursued after Coriantumr, and he did\\noverthrow many cities, and he did slay both women and children,\\nand he did burn the cities.\\n\\nEther 14:18\\n 18 And there went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a\\ncry went forth throughout the land--Who can stand before the army\\nof Shiz?  Behold, he sweepeth the earth before him!\\n\\nEther 14:19\\n 19 And it came to pass that the people began to flock together\\nin armies, throughout all the face of the land.\\n\\nEther 14:20\\n 20 And they were divided; and a part of them fled to the army of\\nShiz, and a part of them fled to the army of Coriantumr.\\n\\nEther 14:21\\n 21 And so great and lasting had been the war, and so long had\\nbeen the scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of\\nthe land was covered with the bodies of the dead.\\n\\nEther 14:22\\n 22 And so swift and speedy was the war that there was none left\\nto bury the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of\\nblood to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies of both men,\\nwomen, and children strewed upon the face of the land, to become\\na prey to the worms of the flesh.\\n\\nEther 14:23\\n 23 And the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land,\\neven upon all the face of the land; wherefore the people became\\ntroubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof.\\n\\nEther 14:24\\n 24 Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue Coriantumr; for he\\nhad sworn to avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his\\nbrother, who had been slain, and the word of the Lord which came\\nto Ether that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword.\\n\\nEther 14:25\\n 25 And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in the fulness\\nof his wrath, and their wickedness and abominations had prepared\\na way for their everlasting destruction.\\n\\nEther 14:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that Shiz did pursue Coriantumr eastward,\\neven to the borders by the seashore, and there he gave battle\\nunto Shiz for the space of three days.\\n\\nEther 14:27\\n 27 And so terrible was the destruction among the armies of Shiz\\nthat the people began to be frightened, and began to flee before\\nthe armies of Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor,\\nand swept off the inhabitants before them, all them that would\\nnot join them.\\n\\nEther 14:28\\n 28 And they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor; and\\nCoriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr.  Now the\\nvalley of Shurr was near the hill Comnor; wherefore, Coriantumr\\ndid gather his armies together upon the hill Comnor, and did\\nsound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz to invite them forth to\\nbattle.\\n\\nEther 14:29\\n 29 And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven\\nagain; and they came the second time, and they were driven again\\nthe second time.  And it came to pass that they came again the\\nthird time, and the battle became exceedingly sore.\\n\\nEther 14:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr that he\\ngave him many deep wounds; and Coriantumr, having lost his blood,\\nfainted, and was carried away as though he were dead.\\n\\nEther 14:31\\n 31 Now the loss of men, women and children on both sides was so\\ngreat that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue\\nthe armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, they returned to their camp.\\n\\nEther 15\\nChapter 15\\n\\nEther 15:1\\n 1 And it came to pass when Coriantumr had recovered of his\\nwounds, he began to remember the words which Ether had spoken\\nunto him.\\n\\nEther 15:2\\n 2 He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly\\ntwo millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart;\\nyea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also\\ntheir wives and their children.\\n\\nEther 15:3\\n 3 He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to\\nremember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the\\nprophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far,\\nevery whit; and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted.\\n\\nEther 15:4\\n 4 And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto Shiz,\\ndesiring him that he would spare the people, and he would give up\\nthe kingdom for the sake of the lives of the people.\\n\\nEther 15:5\\n 5 And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his epistle he\\nwrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself\\nup, that he might slay him with his own sword, that he would\\nspare the lives of the people.\\n\\nEther 15:6\\n 6 And it came to pass that the people repented not of their\\niniquity; and the people of Coriantumr were stirred up to anger\\nagainst the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred\\nup to anger against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the\\npeople of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr.\\n\\nEther 15:7\\n 7 And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to fall he fled\\nagain before the people of Shiz.\\n\\nEther 15:8\\n 8 And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum,\\nwhich, by interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; wherefore,\\nwhen they came to these waters they pitched their tents; and Shiz\\nalso pitched his tents near unto them; and therefore on the\\nmorrow they did come to battle.\\n\\nEther 15:9\\n 9 And it came to pass that they fought an exceedingly sore\\nbattle, in which Coriantumr was wounded again, and he fainted\\nwith the loss of blood.\\n\\nEther 15:10\\n 10 And it came to pass that the armies of Coriantumr did press\\nupon the armies of Shiz that they beat them, that they caused\\nthem to flee before them; and they did flee southward, and did\\npitch their tents in a place which was called Ogath.\\n\\nEther 15:11\\n 11 And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch\\ntheir tents by the hill Ramah; and it was that same hill where my\\nfather Mormon did hide up the records unto the Lord, which were\\nsacred.\\n\\nEther 15:12\\n 12 And it came to pass that they did gather together all the\\npeople upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain,\\nsave it was Ether.\\n\\nEther 15:13\\n 13 And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of\\nthe people; and he beheld that the people who were for Coriantumr\\nwere gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and the people\\nwho were for Shiz were gathered together to the army of Shiz.\\n\\nEther 15:14\\n 14 Wherefore, they were for the space of four years gathering\\ntogether the people, that they might get all who were upon the\\nface of the land, and that they might receive all the strength\\nwhich it was possible that they could receive.\\n\\nEther 15:15\\n 15 And it came to pass that when they were all gathered\\ntogether, every one to the army which he would, with their wives\\nand their children--both men women and children being armed with\\nweapons of war, having shields, and breastplates, and\\nhead-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war--they did\\nmarch forth one against another to battle; and they fought all\\nthat day, and conquered not.\\n\\nEther 15:16\\n 16 And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary,\\nand retired to their camps; and after they had retired to their\\ncamps they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of\\nthe slain of their people; and so great were their cries, their\\nhowlings and lamentations, that they did rend the air\\nexceedingly.\\n\\nEther 15:17\\n 17 And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to\\nbattle, and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless, they\\nconquered not, and when the night came again they did rend the\\nair with their cries, and their howlings, and their mournings,\\nfor the loss of the slain of their people.\\n\\nEther 15:18\\n 18 And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle\\nunto Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but\\nthat he would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the\\npeople.\\n\\nEther 15:19\\n 19 And behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with\\nthem, and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people; for\\nthey were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the\\nblindness of their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore\\nthey went again to battle.\\n\\nEther 15:20\\n 20 And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and when\\nthe night came they slept upon their swords.\\n\\nEther 15:21\\n 21 And on the morrow they fought even until the night came.\\n\\nEther 15:22\\n 22 And when the night came they were drunken with anger, even as\\na man who is drunken with wine; and they slept again upon their\\nswords.\\n\\nEther 15:23\\n 23 And on the morrow they fought again; and when the night came\\nthey had all fallen by the sword save it were fifty and two of\\nthe people of Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of the people of\\nShiz.\\n\\nEther 15:24\\n 24 And it came to pass that they slept upon their swords that\\nnight, and on the morrow they fought again, and they contended in\\ntheir might with their swords and with their shields, all that\\nday.\\n\\nEther 15:25\\n 25 And when the night came there were thirty and two of the\\npeople of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of Coriantumr.\\n\\nEther 15:26\\n 26 And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for\\ndeath on the morrow.  And they were large and mighty men as to\\nthe strength of men.\\n\\nEther 15:27\\n 27 And it came to pass that they fought for the space of three\\nhours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.\\n\\nEther 15:28\\n 28 And it came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had\\nreceived sufficient strength that they could walk, they were\\nabout to flee for their lives; but behold, Shiz arose, and also\\nhis men, and he swore in his wrath that he would slay Coriantumr\\nor he would perish by the sword.\\n\\nEther 15:29\\n 29 Wherefore, he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did\\novertake them; and they fought again with the sword.  And it came\\nto pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were\\nCoriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with the loss of\\nblood.\\n\\nEther 15:30\\n 30 And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his\\nsword, that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.\\n\\nEther 15:31\\n 31 And it came to pass that after he had smitten off the head of\\nShiz, that Shiz raised upon his hands and fell; and after that he\\nhad struggled for breath, he died.\\n\\nEther 15:32\\n 32 And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the earth, and\\nbecame as if he had no life.\\n\\nEther 15:33\\n 33 And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him: Go forth. \\nAnd he went forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all\\nbeen fulfilled; and he finished his record; (and the hundredth\\npart I have not written) and he hid them in a manner that the\\npeople of Limhi did find them.\\n\\nEther 15:34\\n 34 Now the last words which are written by Ether are these:\\nWhether the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the\\nwill of the Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that\\nI am saved in the kingdom of God.  Amen.\\n\\nMoroni\\nTHE BOOK OF MORONI\\n\\nMoroni 1\\nChapter 1\\n\\nMoroni 1:1\\n 1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the\\naccount of the people of Jared, I had supposed not to have\\nwritten more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not\\nmyself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.\\n\\nMoroni 1:2\\n 2 For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among\\nthemselves; and because of their hatred they put to death every\\nNephite that will not deny the Christ.\\n\\nMoroni 1:3\\n 3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander\\nwhithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.\\n\\nMoroni 1:4\\n 4 Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I\\nhad supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more;\\nbut I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth\\nunto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day, according to\\nthe will of the Lord.\\n\\nMoroni 2\\nChapter 2\\n\\nMoroni 2:1\\n 1 The words of Christ, which he spake unto his disciples, the\\ntwelve whom he had chosen, as he laid his hands upon them--\\n\\nMoroni 2:2\\n 2 And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the\\nFather in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this\\nye shall have power that to him upon whom ye shall lay your\\nhands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give\\nit, for thus do mine apostles.\\n\\nMoroni 2:3\\n 3 Now Christ spake these words unto them at the time of his\\nfirst appearing; and the multitude heard it not, but the\\ndisciples heard it; and on as many as they laid their hands, fell\\nthe Holy Ghost.\\n\\nMoroni 3\\nChapter 3\\n\\nMoroni 3:1\\n 1 The manner which the disciples, who were called the elders of\\nthe church, ordained priests and teachers--\\n\\nMoroni 3:2\\n 2 After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ,\\nthey laid their hands upon them, and said:\\n\\nMoroni 3:3\\n 3 In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest, (or,\\nif he be a teacher) I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach\\nrepentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the\\nendurance of faith on his name to the end.  Amen.\\n\\nMoroni 3:4\\n 4 And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers,\\naccording to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they\\nordained them by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.\\n\\nMoroni 4\\nChapter 4\\n\\nMoroni 4:1\\n 1 The manner of their elders and priests administering the flesh\\nand blood of Christ unto the church; and they administered it\\naccording to the commandments of Christ; wherefore we know the\\nmanner to be true; and the elder or priest did minister it--\\n\\nMoroni 4:2\\n 2 And they did kneel down with the church, and pray to the\\nFather in the name of Christ, saying:\\n\\nMoroni 4:3\\n 3 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son,\\nJesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of\\nall those who partake of it; that they may eat in remembrance of\\nthe body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal\\nFather, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy\\nSon, and always remember him, and keep his commandments which he\\nhath given them, that they may always have his Spirit to be with\\nthem.  Amen.\\n\\nMoroni 5\\nChapter 5\\n\\nMoroni 5:1\\n 1 The manner of administering the wine--Behold, they took the\\ncup, and said:\\n\\nMoroni 5:2\\n 2 O God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee, in the name of thy\\nSon, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this wine to the souls\\nof all those who drink of it, that they may do it in remembrance\\nof the blood of thy Son, which was shed for them; that they may\\nwitness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they do always\\nremember him, that they may have his Spirit to be with them. \\nAmen.\\n\\nMoroni 6\\nChapter 6\\n\\nMoroni 6:1\\n 1 And now I speak concerning baptism.  Behold, elders, priests,\\nand teachers were baptized; and they were not baptized save they\\nbrought forth fruit meet that they were worthy of it.\\n\\nMoroni 6:2\\n 2 Neither did they receive any unto baptism save they came forth\\nwith a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and witnessed unto the\\nchurch that they truly repented of all their sins.\\n\\nMoroni 6:3\\n 3 And none were received unto baptism save they took upon them\\nthe name of Christ, having a determination to serve him to the\\nend.\\n\\nMoroni 6:4\\n 4 And after they had been received unto baptism, and were\\nwrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they\\nwere numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their\\nnames were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by\\nthe good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them\\ncontinually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits\\nof Christ, who was the author and the finisher of their faith.\\n\\nMoroni 6:5\\n 5 And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and\\nto speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.\\n\\nMoroni 6:6\\n 6 And they did meet together oft to partake of bread and wine,\\nin remembrance of the Lord Jesus.\\n\\nMoroni 6:7\\n 7 And they were strict to observe that there should be no\\niniquity among them; and whoso was found to commit iniquity, and\\nthree witnesses of the church did condemn them before the elders,\\nand if they repented not, and confessed not, their names were\\nblotted out, and they were not numbered among the people of\\nChrist.\\n\\nMoroni 6:8\\n 8 But as oft as they repented and sought forgiveness, with real\\nintent, they were forgiven.\\n\\nMoroni 6:9\\n 9 And their meetings were conducted by the church after the\\nmanner of the workings of the Spirit, and by the power of the\\nHoly Ghost; for as the power of the Holy Ghost led them whether\\nto preach, or to exhort, or to pray, or to supplicate, or to\\nsing, even so it was done.\\n\\nMoroni 7\\nChapter 7\\n\\nMoroni 7:1\\n 1 And now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father\\nMormon, which he spake concerning faith, hope, and charity; for\\nafter this manner did he speak unto the people, as he taught them\\nin the synagogue which they had built for the place of worship.\\n\\nMoroni 7:2\\n 2 And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it\\nis by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and\\nhis holy will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I\\nam permitted to speak unto you at this time.\\n\\nMoroni 7:3\\n 3 Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the church, that\\nare the peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a\\nsufficient hope by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord,\\nfrom this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.\\n\\nMoroni 7:4\\n 4 And now my brethren, I judge these things of you because of\\nyour peaceable walk with the children of men.\\n\\nMoroni 7:5\\n 5 For I remember the word of God, which saith by their works ye\\nshall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good\\nalso.\\n\\nMoroni 7:6\\n 6 For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that\\nwhich is good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God,\\nexcept he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.\\n\\nMoroni 7:7\\n 7 For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.\\n\\nMoroni 7:8\\n 8 For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it\\ngrudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he\\nhad retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.\\n\\nMoroni 7:9\\n 9 And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall\\npray and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him\\nnothing, for God receiveth none such.\\n\\nMoroni 7:10\\n 10 Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that which is good;\\nneither will he give a good gift.\\n\\nMoroni 7:11\\n 11 For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water;\\nneither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water; wherefore,\\na man being a servant of the devil cannot follow Christ; and if\\nhe follow Christ he cannot be a servant of the devil.\\n\\nMoroni 7:12\\n 12 Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of God; and that\\nwhich is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto\\nGod, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and\\nenticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.\\n\\nMoroni 7:13\\n 13 But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do\\ngood continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and\\nenticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is\\ninspired of God.\\n\\nMoroni 7:14\\n 14 Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not\\njudge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and\\nof God to be of the devil.\\n\\nMoroni 7:15\\n 15 For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that\\nye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain,\\nthat ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is\\nfrom the dark night.\\n\\nMoroni 7:16\\n 16 For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that\\nhe may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to\\njudge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade\\nto believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of\\nChrist; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of\\nGod.\\n\\nMoroni 7:17\\n 17 But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe\\nnot in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know\\nwith a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this\\nmanner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good,\\nno, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject\\nthemselves unto him.\\n\\nMoroni 7:18\\n 18 And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which\\nye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do\\nnot judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge\\nye shall also be judged.\\n\\nMoroni 7:19\\n 19 Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search\\ndiligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from\\nevil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn\\nit not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.\\n\\nMoroni 7:20\\n 20 And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold\\nupon every good thing?\\n\\nMoroni 7:21\\n 21 And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak;\\nand I will tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good\\nthing.\\n\\nMoroni 7:22\\n 22 For behold, God knowing all things, being from everlasting to\\neverlasting, behold, he sent angels to minister unto the children\\nof men, to make manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in\\nChrist there should come every good thing.\\n\\nMoroni 7:23\\n 23 And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that\\nChrist should come.\\n\\nMoroni 7:24\\n 24 And behold, there were divers ways that he did manifest\\nthings unto the children of men, which were good; and all things\\nwhich are good cometh of Christ; otherwise men were fallen, and\\nthere could no good thing come unto them.\\n\\nMoroni 7:25\\n 25 Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word\\nwhich proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to\\nexercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold\\nupon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of\\nChrist.\\n\\nMoroni 7:26\\n 26 And after that he came men also were saved by faith in his\\nname; and by faith, they become the sons of God.  And as sure as\\nChrist liveth he spake these words unto our fathers, saying:\\nWhatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is\\ngood, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall\\nbe done unto you.\\n\\nMoroni 7:27\\n 27 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased because\\nChrist hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right\\nhand of God, to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he\\nhath upon the children of men?\\n\\nMoroni 7:28\\n 28 For he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all\\nthose who have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will\\ncleave unto every good thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause\\nof the children of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.\\n\\nMoroni 7:29\\n 29 And because he hath done this, my beloved brethren, have\\nmiracles ceased?  Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels\\nceased to minister unto the children of men.\\n\\nMoroni 7:30\\n 30 For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according\\nto the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of\\nstrong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.\\n\\nMoroni 7:31\\n 31 And the office of their ministry is to call men unto\\nrepentance, and to fulfill and to do the work of the covenants of\\nthe Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to\\nprepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word\\nof Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear\\ntestimony of him.\\n\\nMoroni 7:32\\n 32 And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the\\nresidue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may\\nhave place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and\\nafter this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants\\nwhich he hath made unto the children of men.\\n\\nMoroni 7:33\\n 33 And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall\\nhave power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.\\n\\nMoroni 7:34\\n 34 And he hath said: Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come\\nunto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that\\nye may be saved.\\n\\nMoroni 7:35\\n 35 And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these\\nthings are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show\\nunto you, with power and great glory at the last day, that they\\nare true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased?\\n\\nMoroni 7:36\\n 36 Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men?  Or\\nhas he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them?  Or will\\nhe, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or\\nthere shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?\\n\\nMoroni 7:37\\n 37 Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles\\nare wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister\\nunto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the\\nchildren of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain.\\n\\nMoroni 7:38\\n 38 For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ,\\nsave they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these\\nthings have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the\\nstate of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption\\nmade.\\n\\nMoroni 7:39\\n 39 But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of\\nyou, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your\\nmeekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not fit to\\nbe numbered among the people of his church.\\n\\nMoroni 7:40\\n 40 And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you\\nconcerning hope.  How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save\\nye shall have hope?\\n\\nMoroni 7:41\\n 41 And what is it that ye shall hope for?  Behold I say unto you\\nthat ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the\\npower of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and\\nthis because of your faith in him according to the promise.\\n\\nMoroni 7:42\\n 42 Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for\\nwithout faith there cannot be any hope.\\n\\nMoroni 7:43\\n 43 And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith\\nand hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.\\n\\nMoroni 7:44\\n 44 If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable\\nbefore God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be\\nmeek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy\\nGhost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for\\nif he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs\\nhave charity.\\n\\nMoroni 7:45\\n 45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and\\nis not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,\\nthinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in\\nthe truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all\\nthings, endureth all things.\\n\\nMoroni 7:46\\n 46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye\\nare nothing, for charity never faileth.  Wherefore, cleave unto\\ncharity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail--\\n\\nMoroni 7:47\\n 47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth\\nforever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it\\nshall be well with him.\\n\\nMoroni 7:48\\n 48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all\\nthe energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which\\nhe hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son,\\nJesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he\\nshall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is;\\nthat we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is\\npure.  Amen.\\n\\nMoroni 8\\nChapter 8\\n\\nMoroni 8:1\\n 1 An epistle of my father Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it\\nwas written unto me soon after my calling to the ministry.  And\\non this wise did he write unto me, saying:\\n\\nMoroni 8:2\\n 2 My beloved son, Moroni, I rejoice exceedingly that your Lord\\nJesus Christ hath been mindful of you, and hath called you to his\\nministry, and to his holy work.\\n\\nMoroni 8:3\\n 3 I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying\\nunto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that\\nhe, through his infinite goodness and grace, will keep you\\nthrough the endurance of faith on his name to the end.\\n\\nMoroni 8:4\\n 4 And now, my son, I speak unto you concerning that which\\ngrieveth me exceedingly; for it grieveth me that there should\\ndisputations rise among you.\\n\\nMoroni 8:5\\n 5 For, if I have learned the truth, there have been disputations\\namong you concerning the baptism of your little children.\\n\\nMoroni 8:6\\n 6 And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently,\\nthat this gross error should be removed from among you; for, for\\nthis intent I have written this epistle.\\n\\nMoroni 8:7\\n 7 For immediately after I had learned these things of you I\\ninquired of the Lord concerning the matter.  And the word of the\\nLord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:\\n\\nMoroni 8:8\\n 8 Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and\\nyour God.  Behold, I came into the world not to call the\\nrighteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician,\\nbut they that are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for\\nthey are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of\\nAdam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them;\\nand the law of circumcision is done away in me.\\n\\nMoroni 8:9\\n 9 And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of\\nGod unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn\\nmockery before God, that ye should baptize little children.\\n\\nMoroni 8:10\\n 10 Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye\\nteach--repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and\\ncapable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must\\nrepent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little\\nchildren, and they shall all be saved with their little children.\\n\\nMoroni 8:11\\n 11 And their little children need no repentance, neither\\nbaptism.  Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling\\nthe commandments unto the remission of sins.\\n\\nMoroni 8:12\\n 12 But little children are alive in Christ, even from the\\nfoundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and\\nalso a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how many\\nlittle children have died without baptism!\\n\\nMoroni 8:13\\n 13 Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without\\nbaptism, these must have gone to an endless hell.\\n\\nMoroni 8:14\\n 14 Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little\\nchildren need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the\\nbonds of iniquity, for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity;\\nwherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go\\ndown to hell.\\n\\nMoroni 8:15\\n 15 For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one\\nchild because of baptism, and the other must perish because he\\nhath no baptism.\\n\\nMoroni 8:16\\n 16 Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after\\nthis manner, for they shall perish except they repent.  Behold, I\\nspeak with boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not\\nwhat man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear.\\n\\nMoroni 8:17\\n 17 And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love;\\nwherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love\\nlittle children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and\\npartakers of salvation.\\n\\nMoroni 8:18\\n 18 For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a\\nchangeable being; but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all\\neternity.\\n\\nMoroni 8:19\\n 19 Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful\\nwickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they\\nare all alive in him because of his mercy.\\n\\nMoroni 8:20\\n 20 And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth\\nthe mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement of him\\nand the power of his redemption.\\n\\nMoroni 8:21\\n 21 Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an\\nendless torment.  I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me. \\nListen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the\\njudgment-seat of Christ.\\n\\nMoroni 8:22\\n 22 For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, and\\nalso all they that are without the law.  For the power of\\nredemption cometh on all them that have no law; wherefore, he\\nthat is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation,\\ncannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing--\\n\\nMoroni 8:23\\n 23 But it is mockery before God, denying the mercies of Christ,\\nand the power of his Holy Spirit, and putting trust in dead\\nworks.\\n\\nMoroni 8:24\\n 24 Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for repentance is\\nunto them that are under condemnation and under the curse of a\\nbroken law.\\n\\nMoroni 8:25\\n 25 And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism\\ncometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the\\nfulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;\\n\\nMoroni 8:26\\n 26 And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of\\nheart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the\\nvisitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope\\nand perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer,\\nuntil the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with\\nGod.\\n\\nMoroni 8:27\\n 27 Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out\\nsoon against the Lamanites.  Behold, the pride of this nation, or\\nthe people of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction except\\nthey should repent.\\n\\nMoroni 8:28\\n 28 Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. \\nBut behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with\\nthem; and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put\\ndown all power and authority which cometh from God; and they are\\ndenying the Holy Ghost.\\n\\nMoroni 8:29\\n 29 And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must\\nperish soon, unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were\\nspoken by the prophets, as well as the words of our Savior\\nhimself.\\n\\nMoroni 8:30\\n 30 Farewell, my son, until I shall write unto you, or shall meet\\nyou again.  Amen.\\n\\nMoroni 9\\nChapter 9\\n\\nMoroni 9:1\\n 1 My beloved son, I write unto you again that ye may know that I\\nam yet alive; but I write somewhat of that which is grievous.\\n\\nMoroni 9:2\\n 2 For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in\\nwhich we did not conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword,\\nand also Luram and Emron; yea, and we have lost a great number of\\nour choice men.\\n\\nMoroni 9:3\\n 3 And now behold, my son, I fear lest the Lamanites shall\\ndestroy this people; for they do not repent, and Satan stirreth\\nthem up continually to anger one with another.\\n\\nMoroni 9:4\\n 4 Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak\\nthe word of God with sharpness they tremble and anger against me;\\nand when I use no sharpness they harden their hearts against it;\\nwherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased\\nstriving with them.\\n\\nMoroni 9:5\\n 5 For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth me that they\\nhave no fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards\\nanother; and they thirst after blood and revenge continually.\\n\\nMoroni 9:6\\n 6 And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let\\nus labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should\\nbe brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform\\nwhilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy\\nof all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.\\n\\nMoroni 9:7\\n 7 And now I write somewhat concerning the sufferings of this\\npeople.  For according to the knowledge which I have received\\nfrom Amoron, behold, the Lamanites have many prisoners, which\\nthey took from the tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women,\\nand children.\\n\\nMoroni 9:8\\n 8 And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they\\nhave slain; and they feed the women upon the flesh of their\\nhusbands, and the children upon the flesh of their fathers; and\\nno water, save a little, do they give unto them.\\n\\nMoroni 9:9\\n 9 And notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites,\\nit doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum.  For behold,\\nmany of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners;\\nand after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious\\nabove all things, which is chastity and virtue--\\n\\nMoroni 9:10\\n 10 And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a\\nmost cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and\\nafter they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild\\nbeasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it\\nfor a token of bravery.\\n\\nMoroni 9:11\\n 11 O my beloved son, how can a people like this, that are\\nwithout civilization--\\n\\nMoroni 9:12\\n 12 (And only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil\\nand a delightsome people)\\n\\nMoroni 9:13\\n 13 But O my son, how can a people like this, whose delight is in\\nso much abomination--\\n\\nMoroni 9:14\\n 14 How can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment\\nagainst us?\\n\\nMoroni 9:15\\n 15 Behold, my heart cries: Wo unto this people.  Come out in\\njudgment, O God, and hide their sins, and wickedness, and\\nabominations from before thy face!\\n\\nMoroni 9:16\\n 16 And again, my son, there are many widows and their daughters\\nwho remain in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which\\nthe Lamanites did not carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has\\ncarried away, and left them to wander whithersoever they can for\\nfood; and many old women do faint by the way and die.\\n\\nMoroni 9:17\\n 17 And the army which is with me is weak; and the armies of the\\nLamanites are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled\\nto the army of Aaron have fallen victims to their awful\\nbrutality.\\n\\nMoroni 9:18\\n 18 O the depravity of my people!  They are without order and\\nwithout mercy.  Behold, I am but a man, and I have but the\\nstrength of a man, and I cannot any longer enforce my commands.\\n\\nMoroni 9:19\\n 19 And they have become strong in their perversion; and they are\\nalike brutal, sparing none, neither old nor young; and they\\ndelight in everything save that which is good; and the suffering\\nof our women and our children upon all the face of this land doth\\nexceed everything; yea, tongue cannot tell, neither can it be\\nwritten.\\n\\nMoroni 9:20\\n 20 And now, my son, I dwell no longer upon this horrible scene. \\nBehold, thou knowest the wickedness of this people; thou knowest\\nthat they are without principle, and past feeling; and their\\nwickedness doth exceed that of the Lamanites.\\n\\nMoroni 9:21\\n 21 Behold, my son, I cannot recommend them unto God lest he\\nshould smite me.\\n\\nMoroni 9:22\\n 22 But behold, my son, I recommend thee unto God, and I trust in\\nChrist that thou wilt be saved; and I pray unto God that he will\\nspare thy life, to witness the return of his people unto him, or\\ntheir utter destruction; for I know that they must perish except\\nthey repent and return unto him.\\n\\nMoroni 9:23\\n 23 And if they perish it will be like unto the Jaredites,\\nbecause of the wilfulness of their hearts, seeking for blood and\\nrevenge.\\n\\nMoroni 9:24\\n 24 And if it so be that they perish, we know that many of our\\nbrethren have deserted over unto the Lamanites, and many more\\nwill also desert over unto them; wherefore, write somewhat a few\\nthings, if thou art spared and I shall perish and not see thee;\\nbut I trust that I may see thee soon; for I have sacred records\\nthat I would deliver up unto thee.\\n\\nMoroni 9:25\\n 25 My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I\\nhave written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may\\nChrist lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the\\nshowing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and\\nlong-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life,\\nrest in your mind forever.\\n\\nMoroni 9:26\\n 26 And may the grace of God the Father, whose throne is high in\\nthe heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who sitteth on the right\\nhand of his power, until all things shall become subject unto\\nhim, be, and abide with you forever.  Amen.\\n\\nMoroni 10\\nChapter 10\\n\\nMoroni 10:1\\n 1 Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write\\nunto my brethren, the Lamanites; and I would that they should\\nknow that more than four hundred and twenty years have passed\\naway since the sign was given of the coming of Christ.\\n\\nMoroni 10:2\\n 2 And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words\\nby way of exhortation unto you.\\n\\nMoroni 10:3\\n 3 Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these\\nthings, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye\\nwould remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children\\nof men, from the creation of Adam even down unto the time that ye\\nshall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.\\n\\nMoroni 10:4\\n 4 And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you\\nthat ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ,\\nif these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere\\nheart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest\\nthe truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.\\n\\nMoroni 10:5\\n 5 And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of\\nall things.\\n\\nMoroni 10:6\\n 6 And whatsoever thing is good is just and true; wherefore,\\nnothing that is good denieth the Christ, but acknowledgeth that\\nhe is.\\n\\nMoroni 10:7\\n 7 And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost;\\nwherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God;\\nfor he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children\\nof men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.\\n\\nMoroni 10:8\\n 8 And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the\\ngifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God.\\n\\nAnd there are different ways that these gifts are administered;\\nbut it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given\\nby the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit\\nthem.\\n\\nMoroni 10:9\\n 9 For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may\\nteach the word of wisdom;\\n\\nMoroni 10:10\\n 10 And to another, that he may teach the word of knowledge by\\nthe same Spirit;\\n\\nMoroni 10:11\\n 11 And to another, exceedingly great faith; and to another, the\\ngifts of healing by the same Spirit;\\n\\nMoroni 10:12\\n 12 And again, to another, that he may work mighty miracles;\\n\\nMoroni 10:13\\n 13 And again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all\\nthings;\\n\\nMoroni 10:14\\n 14 And again, to another, the beholding of angels and\\nministering spirits;\\n\\nMoroni 10:15\\n 15 And again, to another, all kinds of tongues;\\n\\nMoroni 10:16\\n 16 And again, to another, the interpretation of languages and of\\ndivers kinds of tongues.\\n\\nMoroni 10:17\\n 17 And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they\\ncome unto every man severally, according as he will.\\n\\nMoroni 10:18\\n 18 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember\\nthat every good gift cometh of Christ.\\n\\nMoroni 10:19\\n 19 And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember\\nthat he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that all\\nthese gifts of which I have spoken, which are spiritual, never\\nwill be done away, even as long as the world shall stand, only\\naccording to the unbelief of the children of men.\\n\\nMoroni 10:20\\n 20 Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith\\nthere must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must\\nalso be charity.\\n\\nMoroni 10:21\\n 21 And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the\\nkingdom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if\\nye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope.\\n\\nMoroni 10:22\\n 22 And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in despair; and\\ndespair cometh because of iniquity.\\n\\nMoroni 10:23\\n 23 And Christ truly said unto our fathers: If ye have faith ye\\ncan do all things which are expedient unto me.\\n\\nMoroni 10:24\\n 24 And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth--that if the\\nday cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away\\namong you, it shall be because of unbelief.\\n\\nMoroni 10:25\\n 25 And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for\\nthere shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one.  For\\nif there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the\\npower and gifts of God.\\n\\nMoroni 10:26\\n 26 And wo unto them who shall do these things away and die, for\\nthey die in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom\\nof God; and I speak it according to the words of Christ; and I\\nlie not.\\n\\nMoroni 10:27\\n 27 And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time\\nspeedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall\\nsee me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did\\nI not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man,\\nlike as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out\\nof the dust?\\n\\nMoroni 10:28\\n 28 I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies.\\n\\nAnd behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the\\neverlasting God; and his word shall hiss forth from generation to\\ngeneration.\\n\\nMoroni 10:29\\n 29 And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written\\nis true.\\n\\nMoroni 10:30\\n 30 And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ,\\nand lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift,\\nnor the unclean thing.\\n\\nMoroni 10:31\\n 31 And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put\\non thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy\\nstakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more\\nbe confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he\\nhath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.\\n\\nMoroni 10:32\\n 32 Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny\\nyourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of\\nall ungodliness and love God with all your might, mind and\\nstrength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace\\nye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are\\nperfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.\\n\\nMoroni 10:33\\n 33 And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ,\\nand deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the\\ngrace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which\\nis in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins,\\nthat ye become holy, without spot.\\n\\nMoroni 10:34\\n 34 And now I bid unto all, farewell.  I soon go to rest in the\\nparadise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite,\\nand I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you\\nbefore the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge\\nof both quick and dead.

       "'THE BOOK OF MORMON\\n\\nAn Account Written by\\nTHE HAND OF MORMON\\nUPON PLATES\\nTAKEN FROM THE PLATES OF NEPHI\\n\\nWherefore, it is an abridgment of the record of the people of\\nNephi, and also of the Lamanites--Written to the Lamanites, who\\nare a remnant of the house of Israel; and also to Jew and\\nGentile--Written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of\\nprophecy and of revelation--Written and sealed up, and hid up\\nunto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed--To come forth by\\nthe gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof--Sealed\\nby the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in\\ndue time by way of the Gentile--The interpretation thereof by the\\ngift of God.\\n\\nAn abridgment taken from the Book of Ether also, which is a\\nrecord of the people of Jared, who were scattered at the time the\\nLord confounded the language of the people, when they were\\nbuilding a tower to get to heaven--Which is to show unto the\\nremnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord hath\\ndone for their fathers; and that they may know the covenants of\\nthe Lord, that they are not cast off forever--And also to the\\nconvincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the\\nETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations--And now, if\\nthere are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, condemn\\nnot the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the\\njudgment-seat of Christ.\\n\\nTRANSLATED BY JOSEPH SMITH, JUN.\\n\\n\\nTHE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES\\n\\nBe it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto\\nwhom this work shall come: That we, through the grace of God the\\nFather, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which\\ncontain this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi,\\nand also of the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people\\nof Jared, who came from the tower of which hath been spoken.  And\\nwe also know that they have been translated by the gift and power\\nof God, for his voice hath declared it unto us; wherefore we know\\nof a surety that the work is true.  And we also testify that we\\nhave seen the engravings which are upon the plates; and they have\\nbeen shown unto us by the power of God, and not of man.  And we\\ndeclare with words of soberness, that an angel of God came down\\nfrom heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we\\nbeheld and saw the plates, and the engravings thereon; and we\\nknow that it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord\\nJesus Christ, that we beheld and bear record that these things\\nare true.  And it is marvelous in our eyes.  Nevertheless, the\\nvoice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear record of it;\\nwherefore, to be obedient unto the commandments of God, we bear\\ntestimony of these things.  And we know that if we are faithful\\nin Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men, and\\nbe found spotless before the judgment-seat of Christ, and shall\\ndwell with him eternally in the heavens.  And the honor be to the\\nFather, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. \\nAmen.\\n\\nOLIVER COWDERY\\nDAVID WHITMER\\nMARTIN HARRIS\\n\\n\\nTHE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES\\n\\nBe it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto\\nwhom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the\\ntranslator of this work, has shown unto us the plates of which\\nhath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many\\nof the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with\\nour hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which\\nhas the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. \\nAnd this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said\\nSmith has shown unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of\\na surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have\\nspoken.  And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto\\nthe world that which we have seen.  And we lie not, God bearing\\nwitness of it.\\n\\nCHRISTIAN WHITMER\\nJACOB WHITMER\\nPETER WHITMER, JUN.\\nJOHN WHITMER\\nHIRAM PAGE\\nJOSEPH SMITH, SEN.\\nHYRUM SMITH\\nSAMUEL H. SMITH\\n'"
